<h2>Managing Undo Data</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Explain DML and Undo Data Generation.
		<p>
			Undo data is the information needed to reverse the effects of DML 
			statements. It is often referred to as rollback data, but try to avoid 
			this term, from 9i onward are differents concepts: their function is 
			the same, but their management is not. The old mechanism of 
			rollback segments os long outdated, and all databases should use 
			automatic undo management, wich uses undo segments to store 
			undo data.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Database Transactions<br>
				Oracle's mechanism for ensuring transactional integrity is the 
				combination of undo segments and redo log files.<br>
				Any relational database must be able to pass the ACID test:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>A is for Atomicity<br>
						The principle of atomicity states that either all parts of 
						transaction must complete or none of them complete. If the 
						transaction is not complete then a proccess of rollback is launched, 
						returning all the data at the state before the transaction.
					</li>
					<li>C is for Consistency<br>
						The result of a query must be consistent with the state of the 
						database at the time the query started.This principle requires 
						that the database ensure that changed values are not seen 
						by a query started before the change succed. Thorugh the use 
						of undo segments, Oracle guarantees that if a query succeeds, 
						the result will be consistent. If the undo segment is misconfigured 
						then the query may not succeed (Ora-1555: snapshot too old).
					</li>
					<li>I is for Isolation<br>
						An incomplete (that is, uncommitted) transaction must be invisible 
						to the rest of the world. While the transaction is in progress, only 
						the one session that is executing the transaction is allowed to see 
						the changes: all other sessions must see the unchanged data.
					</li>
					<li>D is for Durable<br>
						Once a transaction completes, it must be impossible for the database 
						to lose it.  Oracle Fullfills these with log files. Log files come in two 
						forms- online redo log files and archive redo log files that store 
						a record of every change applied.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Undo Generation<br>
				Whenever a transaction change data, the pre-update version of the data is 
				written out to a rollback segment or to an undo segment. Rollbacks segments 
				can still exist in 12c but since 9i onward oracle introduced the undo segment 
				as an alternative. Oracle strongly advises that all db should use undo segments 
				(rollback segments are for backward compatibility).<br>
				to roll back a transaction means to use data from the undo segment to 
				construct an image of the data as it was before the transaction occurred. 
				Normally this is used when something goes wrong (rollback of transaction, 
				crash...) but the flashback query capability (9i>) using the undo mechanism 
				permit querying the DB as it was at some time in the past, and, of course. any 
				usre can use the rollback command interactively.<br>
				The ACID first (for A) requires that DB keep pre-update versions of data in order that 
				incomplete transactions can be reversed. This type of rollback is permanent and 
				published to all users. Second (for C), for consistency, the DB must be able to 
				present a query with a version of the database as it was at the time the query 
				started. The server process running the query will go to the undo segments and 
				construct what is called a "read-consistent image" of the blocks being queried, if 
				they were changed after the query started. This kind of "rollback" is temporary and 
				visible only to the session running. Third (for I) undo segments are also used for 
				transaction isolation. No transaction can be in any way dependent upon another, 
				incomplete transaction. Even though several transactions may be running concurrently, 
				isolation requires that the end result must be as if the transactions were serialized.<br>
				From 9i> undo data can also used for flashback queries, that allows users to query 
				a past image of the database. For flashback queries, undo data is used to construct 
				a version of one or more tables as they were at some previous time by applying undo 
				data.<br>
				Note: undo segments is incompatible with the use of rollback segments: it is one 
				or the other, depending on settig of the UNDO_MANAGEMENT parameter.By xavi:
				with the exception of SYSTEM segment<br>
				Rollbacks segments can (and one does) still exist in a 12c database. Undo segments 
				can exist only in an undo tablespace, but at db creation time, there may not be an 
				undo tablespace. Therefore, at db creation time, Oracle creates a single old-fashioned 
				rollback segment in the system tablespace, along with the data dictionary. This is 
				used during database creation but is never used in normal running: all user transactions 
				will use undo segments (segment type2 undo).
			</li>
			<li>Executing SQL statements<br>
				The sql concerned in undo are: select, insert, update, delete, commit, rollback.
				<ul>
					<li>Executing a SELECT statement<br>
						The execution of a select statement is a staged  process: the server process 
						executing the statement  will first check wheter the blocks containing the data 
						required are already in memory, in the database buffer cache. If they are proceed, 
						if not the server must locate them on disk and then copy them into the database 
						buffer cache.<br>
						Note: Always remember that servers read blocks from datafiles into the database 
						buffer cache; DBWn writes blocks from the database buffer cache to the datafiles.<br>
						Once the data blocks required for the query are in database buffer cache, any 
						further processing /such as sorting or aggregation) is carried out in the PGA of the 
						session. When the execution is complete, the result set is returned to the user. For 
						consistency, if the query encounters a block  that has been changed since the time 
						the query started, the server process will go to the undo segment that protected the 
						change, locate the old version of the data, and (only for the current query) roll back 
						the change. A similar mechanism guarantees transaction isolation, although this is 
						based on whether the data has been changed. Clearly, if the data needed to do this 
						rollback is no longer in the undo segments, this mechanism will not work: you get 
						"snapshot too old".
					</li>
					<li>Executing an update statement.<br>
						For any DML operation, it's necessary to work on both data blocks and undo blocks, 
						and also to generate redo: the A,C and I of the ACID test require generation of the 
						undo, and the D requires the generation of redo.<br>
						Note: Undo is not the opposite of redo! Redo protects all blocks changes, wheter it is a 
						change to a block of a table segment, an index segment ot an undo segment. As far 
						as redo is concerned, an undo segment is just another segment and any changes 
						to it must be made durable.<br>
						The first step in executing DML is the same as SELECT: the required blocks 
						 must be found in the database buffer cache or copied into it from datafiles. The 
						 only change is that an empty ( or expired -later explained) block of an undo 
						 segment is needed too. First, locks must be place on any rows and associated 
						 index keys that are going to be affected by the operation. Then the redo is 
						 generated: the server process writes to the log buffer the change vectors that 
						 are going to be applied to the data blocks. This generation of redo is applied 
						 both to table block changes and to undo block changes: if a column of a row 
						 is to be updated, then the row ID and the new value of the column are 
						 written to the log buffer (wich is the change that will be applied to the table block) 
						 as wll as the old value. If the columns is part of an index key, the changes to be 
						 applied to the index are also written to the log buffer, toghether with a change 
						 to be applied to an undo block to protect  the index change.<br>
						 Having generated the redo. Having generated the redo, the update is carried out 
						 in the database buffer cache: the block of table data is updated with the new version 
						 of the changed column, and the old version of the changed column is written to the 
						 block of undo segment. From this point until the update is committed, all queries 
						 from other sessions addressing the changed row will be redirected to the undo data. 
						 Only the session that is doing the update will see the actual current version of the 
						 row in the table block. The same principle applies to any associated index changes.
					</li>
					<li>Executing insert and delete statements<br>
						Conceptually, insert and delete are managed in the same fashion as an update. For 
						an insert, the change vector to be applied to the table block (and index) is the bytes 
						that make up the new row. The vector to be applied to the undo block is the row ID 
						of the new row. For a delete the change vector to be written to the undo block is the 
						entire row. A crucial difference between insert and delete is in the amount of undo 
						generated. When a row is inserted, the only undo generated is writing out the new 
						row id to the undo block. This is because to roll back an insert, the only information 
						oracle requires is the row id.<br>
						Note: Insert generates a minimal amount of undo data; delete generates much 
						more.<br>
						For a delete the whole row must be written to the undo block, so that the deletion 
						can be rolled back if need by constructing a statement that will insert the complete 
						row back into the table.
					</li>
					<li>Transaction control: commit and rollback<br>
						Oracle implementation of the relational database paradigm begins a transaction implicitly 
						with the first DML statement. The transaction continues until a commit or rollback statement.<br>
						Executing a Rollback: if something goes wrong, rollback of transactions in progress is 
						completely automatic and is carried out by background process. The rollbacks could be 
						done by pmon if this detect a problem with the session, by the smon if this detect 
						a non clear shutdown previously, etc. A manual rollback requires the user to issue the 
						rollback command, but the mechanism is identical.<br>
						In the case of rollback an update, the pre-update version of the column are stored in the 
						block of undo, that is recovered and used to create an update that recover the original value.<br>
						To roll back an insert oracle retrieves the row id of the inserted row from the undo block and 
						uses it as they for a delete statement on the table.<br>
						To rollback a delete, oracle constructs a complete insert statement from the data in the 
						undo blocks.<br>
						When the roll back action is done, oracle issue a commit that will commit both the original 
						change and the rollback change as one transaction.<br>
						Note: a rollback will itself generate more redo as it executes, perhaps rather more than 
						the original statement.<br>
					</li>
					<li>Executiong a commit<br>
						When you say commit, all that happens physically is that logwr flushes the log buffer to disk. 
						DBWn does absolutely nothing. <br>
						Note:What does DBWn do when you say COMMIT? Absolutely nothing.<br>
						The change vectors written to the redo log are all the change vectors: those applied to data 
						blocks (tables and indexes) and those applied to undo segments.<br>
						Note: The redo log stream includes all changes: those applied to data segments and 
						to undo segments, for both committed and uncommitted transactions.<br>
						The LGWR and DBWn could or not writte uncommited changes to the log files or the data files 
						(respectively). This is not a problem, because if crash, with the use of redo log (that contain 
						the vector change for data(tables,indexes...))  permit recover the data that was commited but 
						not yet writted at the datafiles and to roll back the data that was writted but not commited (with 
						the use of the change vectors of the undo segments writteds in the change vectors in the 
						redo log file).<br>
						Note: In normal running, DBWn writes only a few dirty buffers to disk; when a checkpoint 
						is signaled, it writes all dirty buffers to disk.<br>
					</li>
					<li>DDL and Transaction Control<br>
						The commit and rollback statements only apply to dml. You cannot roll back a DDL statement: 
						once executed, it is immediately durable. Create a table comprise a set of inserts in the data 
						dictionary that are finished with a commit. The possibility of incomplete transactions in the data 
						dictionary could have appalling side efects.<br>
						Note: Any DDL command, or a grant or revoke, will commit the current transaction.<br>
						Because it is not possible to nest transactions (SQL standard does not permit it), executing 
						one or more DML commands followed by a DDL command will commit the whole lot.
					</li>
					<li>The So-called "Autocommit"<br>
						The autocommit does not exist.  When you execute a DDL statement, theres is a perfectly 
						normal commit included in the source code that implements the DDL command. What about 
						when you exit from your user process? SQL*Plus on windows the exit command has built into 
						the commit statement. But if you close the SQL*Plus with the "X" of the windows, the transaction 
						will be roll backed because in the internal implementation of the "X" routine has a rollback. This 
						behavior depends of the program, plattform, etc. It needs to be tested.<br>
						There is a SQL*Plus command "Set AUTOCOMMIT ON" that will cause SQL*Plus append a commit 
						to every DML statement issued.All of this happens in the user process side, not exist the autocommit 
						in the database.
					</li>
					<li>How transactions Use Undo Segments<br>
						When a transaction starts, Oracle will assign it to one (and only one) undo segment. Any
						one transaction can only be protected by one undo segment. It's not possible for the undo 
						data generated by one transaction to cut across multiple undo segments. This is not a problem
						 because undo segments are not of a fixed size. Therefore, if a transaction does manage to 
						 fill its undo segment, Oracle will automatically add another extent to the segment. It's 
						 possible for multiple transactions to share one undo segment, but in normal running this 
						 should not occur. Oracle grow or shrink or drop undo segments automatically. a transaction 
						 updates table or index data blocks, the information needed to roll back the changes is 
						 written out to blocks of the assigned undo segments. All this happens in the database buffer 
						 cache. Oracle guarantees absolutely the A (ACID) therefore all the undo data must be retained 
						 until a transaction commits, if necessary DBWm will write the changed blocks of undo data 
						 to the undo segment in the datafiles. <br>
						 But, by default, Oracle no guarantee the C (ACID), 
						 oracle guaranteess consistency in the sense that if the query succeeds, the results will be 
						 consistent with the state of the DB at the time the query started, but it does not guarantee 
						 that the query will actually succeed. Then we can categorize the undo data : Active undo 
						 is undo data that might be needed to roll back transactions in progress. This data can never 
						 be overwritten, until the transaction complete. Expired undo is undo data from committed 
						 transactions  wich Oracle is no longer obliged to store. This data can be overwritten if 
						 Oracle needs the space for another active transaction. Unexpired undo is an intermediate 
						 category; it is neither active nor expired. The transaction has committed, but the undo 
						 data might be needed for consistent reads.<br>
						 Note: No transaction can ever span multiple undo segments but one undo segment can 
						 support multiple transactions.<br>
						 Note: Active undo can never be overwritten; expired undo can be overwritten. Unexpired 
						 undo can be overwritten but only if theres is unsufficient undo space for active transactions.<br> 
						 With automatic undo management the DBA has no control over wich undo segment will protect 
						 any one transaction. If you want yo can query wich segment has been assigned to each 
						 transaction by querying the view V$TRANSACTION with join to V$SESSION and 
						 DBA_ROLLBACK_SEGS.

	</li>
	<li>Monitor And administer Undo Data<br>
		Undo segments are managed automatically, but you must set the limits.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Error Conditions Related to Undo<br>
				Principles: First, there should always be sufficient undo space available to allow all transactions to 
				continue. Second, there should always be sufficient undo data available for all queries to succed. 
				The first case say that should enough space allocated for the peak usage of active undo data 
				generated by your transaction workload. The second principle requires additional spaces in the 
				undo tablespace to store unexpired undo data that might be needed for read consistency.<br>
				Note: If a DML statement runs out undo space, the portion of it that had already succeeded will 
				be rolled back. The rest of the transaction remains intact, and uncommitted.<br>
				The two possibles errors that we speak are:"ORA-30036: unable to extend segment in undo 
				tablespace" for transactions problems and "ORA-1555: snapshot too old" for select.<br>
				The default behavior is to let the transactions succeed, to allow them to overwrite unexpired undo.
			</li>
			<li>Parameters for Undo Management<br>
				The following 4 parameters control undo: 
				<ul>
					<li>UNDO_MANAGEMENT<br>
					Defaults to AUTO. If manual oracle will not use undo segments at all (for backward 
					compatibility, don't use it). Static parameter.
					</li>
					<li>UNDO_TABLESPACE<br>
						Nominates a tablespace, wich must have been created as undo tablespace, as the active 
						undo tablespace.
					</li>
					<li>UNDO_RETENTION
					</li>
					<li>TEMP_UNDO_ENABLED
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Sizing and Monitoring the Undo Tablespace<br>
				In an advanced environment, you may also have to add space to allow flashback queries as well.
				The algorithm: calculate the rate at wich undo is being generated at your peak workload and 
				multiply by the length of yout longest query. There is a view with all the information: V$UNDOSTAT. 
				If you create the tablespace of undo autoextent you ensure that the transactions will never run out 
				of space, but Oracle will not autoextent for UNDO_RETENTION target, then the select could fail 
				with "snapshot too old".<br>
				The view V$UNDOSTAT show undo activity, captured in 10 minute intervals.<br>
				Example of calculate the size of UNDO tablespace:<br>
				Select * from v$undostat; -- show undo activity captured in 10 minutes interval 
				In our example we have a peak at 281,117 blocks in one 10-minute interval and 
				generated 908 transactions. The query more longer was 1393 seconds. Finally 
				querying DBA_DATA_FILES shows that undo tablespace datafile is 540800 blocks, 
				about 4GB (8KB/block). Doing arithmetic show that the undo generation rate peaks 
				at about 500 blocks a second, so if the longest query is about 1000 seconds, one 
				would need an undo tablespace of about half a million blocks.
			</li>
			<li>Temporary undo<br>
				Temporary undo segments are used for storing undo generated by DML against a 
				global temporary tables. A global temporary table is a table whose definition may be visible 
				to all sessions (hence "global") but whose rows are private to the session that inserted 
				them. The duration of the row is either until commit or until the session terminates (hence 
				"temporary"). The global temporary tables  are often useful offering storage location for 
				data that may be useful for interim result sets, without any need to worry about clearing the 
				data whne it is no longer needed  or ensuring that sessions will not interfere with (or even see) 
				data created by another session. From DB's point of view, global temporary tables are easy 
				to manage. They exist as segments created (and dropped) automatically in a temporary 
				tablespace. Performance on temporary tables is usually superior to performance of permanent 
				tables for 2 reasons: the I/O is direct. The ssions r/w it's temporary segments without going 
				through the buffer cache, and without involving the database writer. The second reason is 
				taht no redo is generated on global temporary tables the purpose of redo us to make changes 
				persistent, and global temporary tables do not store persistent data. Undo data is generated 
				by DML against temporary tables, this is necessary because the usual transactional rules 
				apply. And it follows that redo is generated, because even thought the table may be a temporary 
				segment, the undo segment is not. In earlier releases this caused two problems: a perfomance 
				hit, because of undo segment I/O going via the buffer cache and generating associate redo and 
				the impossibility of transactions against temporary tables in a read-only database: the table 
				might not exist in a read/write tablespace, but the undo segment does. In 12c has a facility  that 
				permits the creation of temporary undo segments in temporary tablespace. This may significantly 
				 improve the performance of trnasactions against temporary tables without compromising the 
				 transactional integrity and also means that transactions can be run against read-only databases, 
				 such as a Data Guard physical standby database.
			</li>
			<li>Creating and Managing Undo Tablespaces<br>
				A undo tablespace is the same as any other tablespace: files can be added, resized, taken online 
				and offline, and moved or renamed. But it is not possible to specify any options regarding storage 
				: you cannot specify automatic segment space management, and you cannot specify a uniform 
				extent size. To create an undo tablespace, use the keyword UNDO: <code> create undo tablespace 
				tablespace_name datafile datafile_name size size [M|G|T] [RETENTION NOGUARANTEE|GUARANTEE];
				</code><br>
				Note: Unless specified at creation time in the datafile clause, the datafile(s) of an undo tablespace 
				will not be set to autoextend. But if your DB is created with dbca, it will enable automatic extension 
				for the undo tablespace's datafile with maximum size unlimited. Automatic extension can be 
				enabled or disabled at any time, as it can be for any datafile.<br>
				The only segment that exist un a undo tablespace is undo segments that will be created automatically. 
				Initially are 10 segments, more will be created if there are more than 10 concurrent transactions. Oracle 
				monitor and adjust the number of segments as necessary. No matter how many undo tablespaces there 
				may be in a database, generally speaking only one will be in use at a time. The segments in the undo 
				tablespace active has the status online and in the other undo tablespace has the status offline. This has 
				2 exceptions: In RAC every instance opening the DB must have it's own undo tablespace. The other 
				exception is that if you change the undo_tablespace parameter, any segment in the proviously nominated 
				tablespace that were supporting a transaction at the time of the change will remain online until the 
				transaction finishes.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Describe the Difference Between Undo data and redo data<br>
		Differences:
		<ul>
			<li>Undo is transient, whereas redo is permanent. Undo data persist for at least the duration of the 
				transactionthat generates it, but possibly for no longer. 
			</li>
			<li>Undo operates at logical level, whereas redo operates at the physical level. Undo data is row oriented: 
				changes are grouped according to the transaction that made them, and within an undo segment 
				all the entries are related to rows of the same transaction. Redo is physically oriented: change 
				vectors are related to physical locations in blocks, by the row ID pointer. There is no relationship between 
				consecutive change vectors in the log buffer or the log files.
			</li>
			<li>Undo can reverse changes, whereas redo can repeat changes.</li>
			<li>Undo resides in tablespaces, whereas redo resides in files.</li>
			<li>Undo and redo are not opposites.Undo is about transactional integrity, whereas redo 
			is about preventing data loss.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Configure Undo Retention<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Configuring undo retention to support log-running queries<br>
				UNDO_RETENTION set in seconds is usually optional. It specifies a target for keeping inactive undo data 
				and determines when it becomes classified as expired thater than unexpired. If you do not set this parameter, or 
				set it to zero, Oracle will still keep data for as long as it can anyway.  THEREFORE by default UNDO_RETENTION 
				is always at the maximum allowed by the size of the tablespace.<br>
				Where the UNDO_RETENTION is not optional  is if you have configured guaranteed undo retention. 
				The default mode of operation for undo is that Oracle will favor transactions over queries. If the 
				sizing of the undo tablespace force to choose between fail transaction or fail a select, Oracle by default choose to fail 
				the select. In other words, the undo retention is only a targetr that Oracle will try to achieve. Some 
				times it's more importatn that the select will be succesful than the transactions (end-of-month billing?), then 
				you prefer to risk in the transactions that will be blocked menawhile the select it's solved Another 
				case is flashback queries wich rely on undo data. Guaranteed undo retention, meaning that undo data 
				will never be overwritten until the time specified by the undo retention has passed, is enable at the 
				tablespace level. This attribute can be specified at undo tablespace creation or alterated later. 
				Once you active an undo tablespace for wich retention guarantee has been specified, all queries 
				will complete successfully, provided they finish within the undo retention time. You will never 
				have "snapshot too old" error again. The downside is that transactions may fail for lack of undo 
				tablespace. If UNDO_RETENTION is set and the undo tablesapce is autoextend , the Oracle will 
				increase the size of the datafile automatically if necessary to keep to the undo retention target. This 
				combination means that bot queries and transactions always succeed if you have enough disk space.
			</li>
			<li>Flashback Query and Undo Retention<br>
				Flashback query can place additional demands on the undo system. Flashback query is a 
				facility that allows users to see the DB as it was at a time in the past:<code>select * from 
				scott.emp as of timestamp (systimestamp-10/1440);</code>. This statement will return 
				al the rows in the scott.emp table that were there 10 minuts ago. To execute flashback query, undo 
				data is used to roll back all the changes. A query that tries to go back a week would almost 
				certainly fail, because the undo data needed to reconstruct a version of the table as it 
				was a week ago will have been overwritten.<br>
				To recover data with a flashback query:<code>insert into scott.emp (select * from scott.emp 
				as of timestamp (systemistamp-1/24) minus select * from scott.emp);</code>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
