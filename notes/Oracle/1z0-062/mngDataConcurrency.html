<h2>Managing Data Concurrency</h2>
<p>DB applications are multiuser. When 2 or more sessions need to access the 
	same data at the same time Oracle offer row and table locking mechanism that 
	will manage this, ensuring data integrity.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Describe the Locking Mechanism and How Oracle Manages Data concurrency<br>
		Internal locks: necessaries for serializing execution of certain critical sections of code 
		or for proteting certain memory structures. OCA don't cover this.<br>
		Application layer: locks are taken and released as sql statements execute. These locks are 
		applied either to rows or to entire tables, automatically or manually. With record and 
		table locking we can arrive at serialization of concurrent acces.
		<ul>
			<li>Shared and Exclusive Locks<br>
				The standard level of locking in Oracle DB guarantees the highest possible level 
				of concurrency. This means that if a session is updating one row, the one row is 
				locked (and nothing else) to prevent other sessions from updating it (other sessions 
				can read it at any time). The lock is held until the transaction completes, either with 
				a commit or rollback.<br>
				This is an exclusive lock: the first session to request the lock on the row gets it, 
				and any other sessions requesting write access must wait. Read access is permited-
				although if the row has been updated by the locking session, then use the undo data.<br>
				Note:Locked rows cannot be updated or deleted by another session, but any other session 
				can still read them.<br>
				Only one session can take an exclusive lock on a row, or a whole table, at a time, shared 
				locks can be taken on the same object by many sessions. It hasn't sense to take a shared 
				on one row, because the only purpose of a row lock is to gain the exclusive access 
				needed to modify the row. Shared locks are taken on whole tables, and many sessions 
				can have a shared lock on the same table. The purpose of taking a shared lock on 
				a table is to prevent another sessions acquiring an exclusive lock on the table: you 
				cannot get an exclusive lock if anyone else already has a shared lock. Exclusive locks 
				on tables are required to execute DDL statements (i.e.: cannot drop a column if another 
				has a shared lock on the table).<br>
				To execute DML on rows a session must acquire exclusive locks on the rows to be 
				changed as well as shared locks on the tables containing the rows. If another session 
				already sa exclusive locks on the rows, the session will hang until the locks are released 
				by a COMMIT or a ROLLLBACK. If another session already has a shared lock on the 
				table and exclusive locks on other rows, that is not a problem. An exclusive lock on the 
				table could be a problem, but the default locking mechanism does not lock whole 
				tables unless this is necessary for DDL statements.<br>
				Note:It's possible to demand an exclusive lock on a whole table, but this has to be 
				specifically requested, and programmers would need a good reason for doing it.<br>
				All DML require at least two locks: an exclusive lock on each row affected and a shared 
				lock on the table containing the row. The exclusive lock prevents another session from 
				interfering with the row, and the shared lock prevents another session from changing 
				the table definition with a DDL statement. This locks are requested automatically. If a 
				DML cannot acquire the exclusive row locks it needs, it will hang until it gets them.<br>
				To execute DDL commands requires an exclusive lock on the object concerned. This 
				cannot be obtained until all DML transactions against the table have finished, thereby 
				releasing both their exclusive row locks and their shared table locks. The exclusive 
				lock required by DDL statements is requested atomatically but if it cannot be obtained 
				typically  because another session already has the shared lock granted for DML then 
				the statement will terminate with an error immediately.<br>
				Note: Any uncommitted insert, update or delete of a row will cause any attempted DDL 
				on the table to fail immediately.<br>				
			</li>
			<li>The enqueue mechanism<br>
				Request for locks are queued. If a session request a lock and cannot get it because 
				another session already has the row or object locked, the session will wait. Oracle 
				keep track of the order in wich the sessions requested the lock and whe session with 
				the lock releases it, the next session on the queu will be granted te lock and so on. 
				This is the enqueue mechanism.<br>
				If you don't want that the session hang because it's enqueue waiting for the release of 
				the lock then use the NOWAIT (or WAIT if you want the opposite) clause of the 
				SELECT...FOR UPDATE command. A normal SELECT will always succeed, because 
				SELECT dows not require any locks- but a DML statement will hang. The SELECT...
				FOR UPDATE command will select rows and lock them in exclusive mode. If any 
				of the rows are locked already, the stament will be queued and the session will hang 
				until the locks are released, just as a DML. To avoid sessions hanging, use either 
				SELECT...FOR UPDATE NOWAIT or SELECT...FOR UPDATE WAIT <n> where <n> is 
				a number of seconds. Having obtained the locks, you can then issue the DML commands 
				with no possibility of the session hanging.<br>
				Note:It's possible to append the keywords SKIP LOCKED to a SELECT FOR UPDATE 
				statement, wich will return and lock only rows that are not already locked  by 
				another session.
			</li>
			<li>Automatic and Manual Locking<br>
				Whenever any DML is executed, automatically take a shared lock on the table and 
				exclusive locks on the affected rows. The release of the locks are automatically when 
				the transactions is completed with either COMMIT or ROLLBACK.<br>
				Whenever any DDL is executed, the session will automatically take an exclusive lock 
				on the entire object. The lock persists for the duration of the DDL and is released 
				automatically when the statement completes.<br>
				Manually locking objects: <code>lock table table_name in mode mode</code> where 
				mode:
				<table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
					<thead>
						<tr><td></td><td>Row Share</td><td>Row Exclusive</td><td>Share</td>
							<td>Share Row Exclusive</td><td>Exclusive</td>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr><td>Row Share</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td>
							<td>Y</td><td>N</td>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Row Exclusive</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td>
							<td>N</td><td>N</td>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Share</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td>
							<td>N</td>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Share Row Exclusive</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td>
							<td>N</td><td>N</td>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Exclusive</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td>
							<td>N</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				A ROW SHARE lock permits DML by other sessions, but will prevent any other session 
				from taking an exclusive lock on the table.A EXCLUSIVE lock is needed 
				(and requested automatically) in order to drop the table.ROW SHARE will therefore 
				ensure that the table is not dropped by another session. In practice, the only type 
				of lock that is ever likely to be taken manually is the EXCLUSIVE lock preventing 
				another sessions from performing any DML against the table.<br>
				The DML statements automatically take a table lock in row exclusive mode.<br>
				The table locks(TM):
				<ul>
					<li>A row share lock (RS), also called a subshare table lock (SS), indicates that 
						the transaction holding the lock on the table has locked rows in the table and 
						intends to update them. An SS lock is the least restrictive mode of table lock, 
						offering the highest degree of concurrency for a table.
					</li>
					<li>A row exclusive lock (RX), also called a subexclusive table lock (SX), indicates 
						that the transaction holding the lock has updated table rows or issued 
						SELECT ... FOR UPDATE. An SX lock allows other transactions to query, insert, 
						update, delete, or lock rows concurrently in the same table. Therefore, SX 
						locks allow multiple transactions to obtain simultaneous SX and SS locks for the 
						same table.
					</li>
					<li>A share table lock (S) held by one transaction allows other transactions to 
						query the table (without using SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) but allows updates only 
						if a single transaction holds the share table lock. Multiple transactions may hold 
						a share table lock concurrently, so holding this lock is not sufficient to ensure 
						that a transaction can modify the table.
					</li>
					<li>A share row exclusive table lock (SRX), also called a share-subexclusive table 
						lock (SSX), is more restrictive than a share table lock. Only one transaction at a 
						time can acquire an SSX lock on a given table. An SSX lock held by a transaction 
						allows other transactions to query the table (except for SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) 
						but not to update the table.
					</li>
					<li>An exclusive table lock (X) is the most restrictive mode of table lock, allowing 
						the transaction that holds the lock exclusive write access to the table. Only 
						one transaction can obtain an X lock for a table.
					</li>
				</ul>
				The only row lock(TX) lock a single row.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<li>Monitor And Resolve Locking Conflicts<br>
		The lock contention can cause the db performance will be deteriorate because all the sessions 
		 are queueing and waiting for locks. A special case of lock contention is the deadlock, wich is 
		 always resolved automatically by the database itself.
		 <ul>
			<li>The causes of lock contention<br>
				Some lockings are necessary part of business data processing but some faults in 
				application design can exacerbate the problem. Long-running transactions will cause 
				problems. An obvious case is where a user updates a row and then does not commit the 
				change. This should never occur with well-written software.<br>
				When you have a long in time transaction like the accounting end month, maybe the 
				programmers need to change the one long transaction to a set of orderly 
				intermediate transactions. But in this case the programmers need to worry about the 
				whole pseudo-transaction and find a form of "rollback" everything in case of fail of, for 
				example, fail the last real transaction.<br>
				Another problem coul be the repeatable reads. for example if you do: <code>
				select * from regions</code>, this return 4 rows, but immediatly you do <code>
				select count(*) from regions;</code> and return 5. How it's possible? During the 
				course of the first query another session inserted and committed the fifth row. To solve 
				this you can lock the whole table or a more sophisticated way would be to use the 
				SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY statement. This will guarantee (without imposing any locks) 
				that the session does not see any DML on any tables, committed or not, until it 
				terminates the read-only transation with a commit or rollback (based on undo segments).
			</li>
			<li>Detecting Lock Contention<br>
				Lock contention can be seen in the V$session view. The column SID (session identifier) 
				identify the session and blocking_session show the sid of the blocking session.
			</li>
			<li>Solving Lock Contention<br>
				Fast solution:<code>alter system kill session 'SID,SERIAL#';</code><br>
				The SID is unique, but because the users login,logoff and then the SID could be reuse 
				and accidentally kill other session. For avoid it, oracle use the SID + SERIAL#
			</li>
			<li>Deadlocks: A special case<br>
				It's a special situation where two sessions block each other and then all will hang waiting 
				for the other to release it's lock.<br>
				Note: You can do nothing about deadlocks other than report them- they are resolved 
				automatically by the database.<br>
				The information about deadlocks are writted to the alert log with full details in a 
				trace file.<br>
				If a deadlocks occurs, both sessions will hang for a brief moment. One of the sessions 
				will detect the deadlock within seconds and it will roll back the statement that caused the 
				problem.
			</li>
