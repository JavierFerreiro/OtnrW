<h1>Managing Database Instance</h1>
<p>
	Note: before a user can connect to EMDBE (enterprise manager database 
	express) the listener must be running.<br>
	To connect to the db two techniques: normal user, with the hash of the 
	password stored in the data dictionary, a privileged user that has the 
	password stored in the external password file or by presenting an O.S. 
	identity that Oracle accepts.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>User database management tools<br>
	The tools discussed: SQL*Plus, DB express graphical utility and the SQL 
	developer.<br>
	<ul>
		<li>SQL*Plus:<br>
			Executable in ORACLE_HOME/bin<br>
			Useful switch: /nolog ->Launch sqlplus without user and password.<br>
			You need to configure ORACLE_HOME for use sqlplus (obviously PATH too
			 if you want to launch it without all the path).<br>
			 The technique of log on a privileged user with a password file consist in 
			 a external password file created with orapwd. If the password write in 
			 sqlplus and the password in the password file match, then access granted.
			 It's useful when you want to connect remotely like sysdba in a remote
			 db no open.<br>
			 The other technique used to enter in a instance not open is using O.S. 
			 authentication. At install time, an OS group was nominated as the SYSDBA 
			 group, if your user is member of that group, then the access is granted 
			 without password<br>
			 A normal connection can user in sqlplus <code>connect username/password 
			 [@connect_string] [as sysdba].</code> a privileged O.S. user can connect 
			 like <code>connect / as sysdba</code>
		</li>
		<li>Express Database<br>
			Database express is a java servlet. Users communicate with it from a browser 
			over an http connection stablished by the database listener.<br>
			The default URL for connect with DB express is : http:/&lt;database-host-name&gt;
			:5500/em . If the port is changed, you can use <code> 
				select dbms_xdb.gethttport() from dual;</code><br>
			To operate with listener: <code>lsnrctl start</code> to start the listener, 
			<code>lsnrctl status</code> to check the status of the listener.<br>
			Express DB does require the Adobe Flash plugin. Without this is not 
			possible to log on.<br>
			To set the port of Express DB: <code>select dbms_xdb.sethttpport(5500);</code>
			All the acces of Express DB is with shared servers mechanism. This require the 
			existence of the DISPATCHER process.<br>
			Note: What are the prerequisites for using Database Express? The listener must be 
			running, a dispatcher must be running, and the XDB must have been used to 
			enable a listening port.
		</li>
		<li>SQL Developer<br>
			More suited to application development than to database administration, but it 
			may still be useful to a DBA on occasion. A version is shipped with the database: 
			ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper.sh
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Understanding Initialization Parameter Files<br>
		An instance is defined by the parameters used to build it in memory. Some 
		of this parameters can be changed in whithout shutdown the instance and 
		other need to restart the instance.
		<ul>
			<li>Static and dynamic parameter files<br>
				Parameter files come into two flavors: the static parameter file ( aka
				 pfile or init file) and the dynamic server parameter file (aka spfile). 
				 The two versions stores values for the parameters used to build the 
				 instance and to start background processes.<br>
				 There are three default filenames: ORACLE_HOME/dbs/spfile&lt;SID
				 &gt;.ora , ORACLE_HOME/dbs/spfile.ora or ORACLE_HOME/dbs/init&gt;
				 SID&lt;.ora . The preceding order is important unless a pfile is specified 
				 in the startup command, using the first file and ignoring the rest. If no 
				 one exist (and non default pfile is specified) the instance will not start.<br>
				 The spfile is the server-side binary file and it cannot be renamed,
				 relocated not edited manually. It's readed by the SMON background 
				 process when the instance is started.<br>
				 The pfile is a client-side file that exist by default in the ORACLE_HOME 
				 directory, but it's in fact read by the user process that issues the command 
				 to start the instance. This file could be moved, edited, etc. but if move, then 
				 you must specify where is when use startup. The pfile is an ASCII file.<br>
				 To change the values of the spfile you must use the ALTER SYSTEM SET... 
				 command from sqlplus or Express DB.<br>
				 To create a pfile use a text editor. To create a spfile use sqlplus command 
				 <code>CREATE SPFILE [ =filename ] FROM PFILE [ =filename ];</code>
				 to convert spfile in text 
				 <code>CREATE PFILE [ =filename ] FROM SPFILE [ =filename ];</code><br>
				 Note: the file spfile&lt;SID&gt;.ora is the most convenient file. Only if you 
				 use RAC the you will only use spfile.ora.
			</li>
			<li>Static and dynamic parameters and the inizialization parameter file<br>
				to view the parameters and their current values: <code>select name,value 
				from v$parameter order by name;</code> to check the values of the 
				spfile then <code>select name,value from v$spparameter order by name</code>
				. The differences between this two views are that some parameters could be 
				changed while the instance are running and not writte on the spfile (when 
				the instance are restarted the new value is lost), you could change the parameter 
				on the instance and in the file or only in the file (normally parameters that can't 
				be change meanwhile the instance is working, needing a restart).<br>
				If the instance is started with the pfile rather than spfile then v$spparameter 
				view will show a null as a value for the parameters.
			</li>
			<li>The basic parameter<br>
				The basic parameters are those that should be considered for every database. To 
				find it: <code> select name,value from v$parameter where isbasic='TRUE' order 
				by name</code>
			</li>
			<li>Changing Parameters<br>
				To change parameters with SQLPlus use alter system command: <code>ALTER 
				SYSTEM SET &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; SCOPE=[memory|spfile|both] </code> 
				The default scope is BOTH. <br>
				<code>ALTER SYSTEM RESET &lt;name&gt; ;</code> remove the value from 
				spfile, it will remain in effect within the instance as it current value until the instance
				is restarted.<br>
				An example of parameter that can be adjusted at instance level or session level 
				 is optimizer_mode: <code>alter system set optimizer_mode=all_rows;</code>
				  or <code>alter session set optimizer_mode=first_rows;</code>
				  note:Logon triggers can be used to adjust session parameters to values suitable 
				  for different users, depending on the username with wich they log on.
			</li>
			<li>Startup and Shutdown an Oracle Database Instance<br>
				The recommended order to start the database is first listener and then database.<br>
				A listener is a process that monitors a port for database connection request. These 
				request and all subsequent traffic use oracle Net (Oracle propietary communications
				 protocol). Oracle Net is a layered protocol running over whatever underlaying 
				 network protocols is in use (probably TCP/IP)<br>
				 The listener utility is in ORACLE_HOME/bin<br>
				To start the listener: <code> lsnrctl start [&lt;listener&gt;]</code>
				To check the status of the listener: <code> lsnrctl status [&lt;listener&gt;]</code><br>
				The default name of the listener is LISTENER.<br>
				To precision, start and stop is the instance, the database is mounted and 
				opened and then dismounted and closed. This can be done with sqlplus using
				the startup and shutdown commands. Ordinary users cannot do this operations, 
				you must be authenticated either by the O.S. (member of group that owns 
				oracle software) or by giving a username/password that exist in external 
				password file. To authenticate with sqlplus you can use connect command .
				 With the connection string oracle distinct between the differents authentication 
				 methods 
				 <code>
					<ol>
						<li>connect user/pass[@connect_alias]</li>
						<li>connect user/pass[@connect_alias] as sysdba</li>
						<li>connect user/pass[@connect_alias] as sysoper</li>
						<li>connect / as sysdba</li>
						<li>connect / as sysdba</li>
					</ol>
				 </code>
				 By Xavi: The first method authenticate using data dictionary, 
				 the second and third use:First try with o.s user authorized if not external password 
				(if use @ then always password file) file and the forth and 
				 five O.S. authentication<br>
				 If you log without user with "as sysdba" the user is SYS. If you log 
				 without user with "as sysoper", the user is PUBLIC.<br>
				 The startup stage is staged:
				 <ol>
					<li>You build the instance in memory.</li>
					<li>You enable a connection to the database by mounting the controlfile.</li>
					<li>You open the database for use.</li>
				 </ol>
				At any moment the database will be in one of four states:
					<ol>
						<li>SHUTDOWN<br>
							All the files are closed and the instance does not exist.
						</li>
						<li>NOMOUNT<br>
							The instance has been built in memory (the SGA has been 
							created and the background processes started) according with 
							the parameter file, but no connection has made to the database 
							(maybe not exist, will be created). The only file used in this 
							stage is the parameter file. The log for example is on 
							DIAGNOSTIC_DEST parameter, the default value for this parameter 
							is the ORACLE_BASE. Within DIAGNOSTIC_DEST is a standard 
							directory structure. The alert log will be on: &lt;DIAGNOSTIC_DEST&gt;/
							diag/rdbms/&lt;DBNAME&gt;/&lt;INSTANCE_NAME&gt;/trace/alert_&lt;instance_name&gt;.log
						</li>
						<li>MOUNT<br>
							The instance locates and reads the control file. The instance knows 
							where is the control file because in te previous step read the 
							parameter file, where is specified in the CONTROL_FILES paramenter. If 
							the control file (or any multiplexed copy of it) is damaged or missing the 
							database will not mount. In this step the instance read the location of all 
							of the datafiles and online redo logs, but don't try to check the existence 
							or read them. 
						</li>
						<li>OPEN<br>
							All the database files are located and opened and the database 
							is made available for use by end users. If the database was shutdown 
							disorderly, then the  in this moment oracle must repair the DB, with 
							a mechanism known as instance recovery.<br>
							The process that mounts and open the database is SMON process.<br>
							When the database is succesfully opened, then oracle permit the login 
							of users with normal data dictionary authentication.
						</li>
					</ol>
					To save time you can use <code>STARTUP FORCE</code> that executes 
					two commands in one: first shutdown abort followed by a startup normal.<br>
					For shutdown you can use the command: <code>SHUTDOWN [normal | 
					transactional | immediate | abort ] </code><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Normal: default. No new user connections will be permitted, but all 
						current connections are allowed to continue. Only once all users have 
						voluntarily logged off will the database actually shut down.
						</li>
						<li>Transactional: No now users are permitted. Existing sessions that 
						are not in a transaction will be terminated. Sessions currently in a 
						transaction are allowed to complete the transaction and then will be 
						terminated. once all the session finish the database will shut 
						down.
						</li>
						<li>Immediate: No new sessions are permitted, and all currently 
						connected sessions are terminated. Any active transaction are rolled 
						back and then the database will be shutdown.
						</li>
						<li>Abort: Equivalent of a power cut. The instance terminate 
						immediatly, nothing is written to disk and there is no attempt 
						to terminate transactions in progress in any orderly fashion.
						</li>
					</ul>
					Note:The normal shutdown is useless because is always someone 
					connected like the cloud control agent.<br>
					Normal, transactional and immediate are considered "clean" or 
					"consistent" shutdowns because after all sessions are disconnected 
					the PMON process will roll back any incomplete transaction. Then a 
					checkpoint is issued that forces the DBWn process to write all 
					updated data from the database buffer cache down to the datafiles.
					LGWR also flushes any change vector to the log files. Then the file 
					headers are updated and the files handles closed.<br>
					To control the stage of the database use the command: 
					<code>alter database &lt;stage&gt;;</code>
			</li>
			<li>View the alert log and Access Dynamic Performance Views<br>
				The alert log is a vital source of information regarding important 
				events of the db.It's a continuos historical record of events.<br>
				The dynamic performance views gives real time information.<br>
				In addition to the alert log there is an optionally enabled DDL log 
				and a debug log generated automatically in the event of certain errors.<br>
				<ul>
					<li>The alert log<br>
						Continuos record of critical operations applied to instances 
						and database. It's location it's derived from the instance 
						parameter DIAGNOSTIC_DEST and the name is 
						alert_&lt;sid&gt;.log . The alert log will be beneath 
						DIAGNOSTIC_DEST/diag/rdbms/&lt;dbname&gt;/&lt;instancename&gt;/trace
						 a copy in xml format is maintained in 
						 DIAGNOSTIC_DEST/diag/rdbms/&lt;dbname&gt;/&lt;instancename&gt;/alert<br>
						 The critical operations recorded in the alert log include:
						 <ul>
							<li>startup and shutdown and intermediate states did it with alter database...</li>
							<li>Internal errors of the instance (ORA-600), the DBA can't do nothing.</li>
							<li>Any detected datafile block corruptions.</li>
							<li>Any row-locking deadlocks that may have occurred.</li>
							<li>All operations that affect the physical structure  of the database: create,
								rename... datafiles,online redo logs....
							</li>
							<li>All alter system that adjust the values of initialization parameters.</li>
							<li>All log switches and log archives.</li>
						 </ul>
						 The alert log start show all the initialization parameters, 
						 if you add this to the previous explained fact that all changed 
						 of structures or parameters are writed, then you can backtrack 
						 all the changes.
					</li>
					<li>The DDL log<br>
						Should the DBA enable if want to record DDL commands in a log file.
						The statement used is loged without any supporting information like 
						who run the statement is recorded in a text file named: 
						ddl_&lt;instancename&gt; in the directory: 
						DIAGNOSTIC_DEST/diag/rdbms/&lt;dbname&gt;/&lt;instancename&gt;/log
						 with the same information in the file log.xml in xml format.<br>
						 To enable DDL logging, the instance parameter ENABLE_DDL_LOGGIN 
						 must be set to TRUE (default FALSE).
					</li>
					<li>The Dynamic Performance Views<br>
						There are more than 600 dynamic performance views . Not all the 
						"Vee dollar" views (pronunciation of V$) are views, some are synonyms 
						to views but the know as "The vee dollar" views.<br>
						Some views are available in all stages, some only in specific stages (like open).<br>
						V$ views are populated from the instance or the controlfile. The DBA_,ALL_,USER_ 
						views are populated from the data dictionary. This determines what views can 
						be queried at the various startup stages.<br>
						Rule: in general V$ views are singular, data dictionary views are plural.
