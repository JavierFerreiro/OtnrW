<h2>Lab of administering User Security</h2>
<h3>Officials</h3>
<p>
Simulate a problem with undo. You will need to be connected as user SYSTEM or 
some other to whom you have granted the DBA role. The figures used on this 
exercises will be valid if the database block size is 8KB.<br>
Create an undo tablespace with a single datafile of only 256KB. Do not set the 
file to autoextend. Set the database to use this small undo segment. Confirm 
that is online by querying the views DBA_ROLLBACK_SEGS and V$ROLLSTAT. Why 
do you think that only one undo segment was created?<br>
Create an empty table based on the ALL_OBJECTS view with this statement: <br>
<code>create table undotest as select * from all_objects where 1=2;</code><br>
Populate this table with the contents of the ALL_OBJECTS view: <br>
<code>insert into undotest select * from all_objects;</code><br>
The statement will fail with an error "ORA-30036": unable to extend segment 
by 8 un undo tablespace". Query the new table, and you will find that it is 
still empty. Why is this?<br>
Adjust the undo tablespace's datafile to autoextend, and attempt to insert 
the contents of the ALL_OBJECTS view into the new table. This time, the 
insertion will succeed. Find out how many blocks of undo are needed to 
support the transaction so far by querying V$TRANSACTION as well as how big 
the new datafile is by querying V$DATAFILE.<br>
Delete every row in the new table and then repeat the queries against 
V$TRANSACTION and V$DATAFILE. You will see that the deletion generated many 
more blocks of undo and required a much larger extension of the undo datafile 
than the insertion. Why is this?<br>
Tidy up by switching back to the original undo tablespace and then dropping 
the test table and tablespace.
