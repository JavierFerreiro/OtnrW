1-Create a table containing 100,000 rows, all of wich are different, and another table with the same number of identical rows.
Analyze the tables to determine how many blocks they occupy. How many blocks do the tables occupy? Enable compression for the 
tables. What compression ratio do you achieve? Delete all the rows from one table, and truncate the other table. How many blocks 
do they occupy now? How would you reduce this?<br>
