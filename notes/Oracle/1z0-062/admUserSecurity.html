<h2>Administering User Security</h2>
<ul>
	<p>User,user account and schema can often be used interchangeably in the oracle 
	environment, nut they are not always the same thing. A user is a person who 
	connects to a user account by stablishing a session against the instance and logging 
	on with the user account name. A schema is a set of objects owned by a user account. 
	A user account must be granted privileges before a session (or sessions) connected to 
	the account can do anything.
	</p>
		
	<li> Create and Manage Database User Accounts<br>
		The account must be specified by a name and authenticated by some means. 
		The account has set (when you create) a serie of attributes. This will be applied 
		to sessions that connect to the account, although some can be modified by 
		the session or the DBA while the session is running. The attributes are:
		<ul>
			<li>Username (mandatory)<br>
				Must be unique in the database and must conform to certain rules. Must 
				begin with a letter,&lt;=30 characters and can consist of only letters, digits 
				and the dollar and underscore sign and cannot be a reserver word. The 
				letters are case sensitive but will be automatically converted to uppercase. 
				All of this rules (with length exception) can be broken if the username is 
				specified within double quotes.
			</li>
			<li>Authentication method<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Operationg System and Password File Authentication<br>
						To enable O.S. and password file authentication (the two go together) for 
						an account, you must grant the user an administration role. The are 
						six of these:
						<table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
							<thead>
								<tr><td>Admin Role</td><td>Group Name</td><td>Capabilities</td>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>SYSDBA</td><td>OSDBA</td>
									<td>Startup and shutdown; all system privileges with admin. Total power</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>SYSOPER</td><td>OSOPER</td>
									<td>Startup and shutdown, nothing else. No privileges on users or data</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>SYSASM</td><td>OSASM</td>
									<td>No relevant to an RDBMS instance.ASM only</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>SYSBACKUP</td><td>OSBACKUPDBA</td>
									<td>Startup and shutdown; create anything; no privileges on data.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>SYSDG</td><td>OSDGDB</td>
									<td>startup and shutdown;privileges necessary to manage Data Guard</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>SYSKM</td><td>OSKMDBA</td>
									<td>Privileges necessary to manage data security and encryption</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						Grant this roles:
						<code>
							Grant [SYSDBA|SYSOPER|SYSASM|SYSBACKUP|SYSDG|SYSKM] to username;
						</code>
						Granting any (or all) of these privileges will copy the user's password from the data 
						dictionary into the external password file, where it can be read by the instance even 
						if the database is not open. Following database creation the only user with these privileges 
						is SYS. It also allows the instance to authenticate users by checking whether the O.S. user 
						attempting the connection is a member of the operationg system group mapped to the 
						oracle group name. On linux the O.S. groups must be specified when installing the Oracle Home.
						If you want to know what are this groups in a linux machine, you can view the file 
						$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/lib/general.c<br>
						Ro use password file authentication, the user can connect with this syntax with SQL*Plus: 
						<code>
							connect username/password [@db_alias] AS [SYSOPER|SYSDBA];
						</code><br>
						To use O.S. authentication, use this syntax on sql*plus: 
						<code>
							connect / as [SYSOPER|SYSDBA];
						</code><br>
						The equivalent of these syntaxes is also available when connecting with DBE (database 
						express).<br>
						To know who has the SYSDBA and SYSOPER privileges query V$PWFILE_USERS.<br>
						Connect with O.S. or password file authentication is always possible, no matter what state the 
						instance and database are in, and is necessary to issue startup and shutdown commands.<br>
						Note: All users must be authenticated. There is no such thing as an "anonymous" login, and 
						some authentication method must be used. there is, however, a user ANONYMOUS: this 
						account is used by APEX applications.<br>
						
						Password Authentication<br>
						The syntax for a connection with password authentication using SQL*Plus is:
						<code>connect username/[password] [@db_alias]</code><br>
						When user connects with password authentication, the instance will validate the 
						password given against the password hash stored in data dictionary (therefore database 
						OPEN). The user SYS is not permitted to connect with password authentication, only 
						password file, O.S. authentication and LDAP authentication are possible for SYS.<br>
						Usernames are case sensitive but are automatically converted to uppercase unles double 
						quotes. Passwords are case sensitive and there is no automatic case conversion, it's not 
						necessary to use double quotes, the password will always read exactly as entered.<br>
						Change the password: <code>alter user username identified by password;</code> 
						Every user can change her password or privileged users (such SYSTEM) that can change 
						any user account password.
					</li>
					<li>External Authentication<br>
						If a user account is created with external authentication, Oracle will delegate the 
						authentication to an external service, oracle will not prompt for a password. If the 
						Advanced Security Option has been licensed, then the external service can be a number 
						of third-party services like Kerberos server, Radius. For example if Kerberos is being 
						used, the database will check that the user does have a valid Kerberos token.<br>
						Without Advanced Security Option, the only form of external authentication that can 
						be used is O.S. authentication. The difference between a normal O.S. authentication 
						(explained before), and a O.S. authentication for normal users (non sysdba or sysoper) 
						is that you need to create a oracle user account with the same names as the O.S. 
						user account but prefixed with a string specified by the instance parameter 
						OS_AUTHENT_PREFIX. This parameter defaults to the string OPS$ (show parameter 
						os_authent_prefix). Then if you want a normal user that use O.S. authentication, then 
						if the O.S. jwatson previously exist, follow this:<br>
						<code>
							create user ops$jwatson identified externally;<br>
							grant create session to ops$jwatson;<br>
						</code>
						Note:Using external authentication can be very useful, but only if the users 
						actually log on to the machine hosting the database. This is rarely is more 
						likely to be of value for accounts used for running maintenance or batch jobs.<br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Default tablespace</li>
				Every user account has a default tablespace, wich is the default tablespace where 
				any schema objects created by the user will reside. The user can have objects 
				in any tablespace that has quota, the default is just this, the default.<br>
				A database-wide default tablespace will be applied to all user accounts if a 
				default tablespace is not specified when creating the user. The default can be set 
				when creating the database and then changed later with: 
				<code>alter database default tablespace tablespace_name</code><br>
				If not default tablespace is specified when the database is created, it will be 
				set to the SYSTEM tablespace (very bad practice).
			<li>Tablespace quotas<br>
				A quota is the amount of space in a tablespace that a user is allowed to occupy. If 
				the user has no quota on a tablespace, he cannot create any objects at all. Quotas 
				can be changed at any time. If the quota is reduced below the size of the objects he 
				already owns, the objects will survive and will still be usable, but the will not be 
				permitted to get any bigger.<br>
				<code>
				    select default_tablespace, temporary_tablespace from dba_users;
					alter user john quota 10m on users;<br>
					alter user john quota unlimited on example;<br>
					select tablespace_name, bytes,max_bytes from dba_ts_quotas<br>
					select property_name, property_value from database_properties where 
					property_name like '%TABLESPACE%';
				</code><br>
				Note: Before you can create a table, you must have both permission to 
				execute create table and a quota on a tablespace in which to create it.
			</li>
			<li>Temporary tablespace<br>
				Permanent objects like tables are stored in permanent tablespaces; temporary 
				objects are stored in temporary tablespaces. A session will need space in a 
				temporary tablespace if it needs space for certain operation that exceed the 
				space available in the session's PGA. Every user account is assigned a temporary 
				tablespace, and all user sessions connecting to the account will share this temporary 
				tablespace.<br>
				Note: Users do not need a quota in their temporary tablespaces.<br>
				A user does not need to be granted a quota on their temporary tablespace, because 
				Ã¹the objects in it are nor actually owned by the user; the are owned by the SYS 
				user who has an unlimited quota on all tablespaces.<br>
				To change a user's temporary tablespace (which will affect all future sessions) use 
				: <code>alter user username temporary tablespace tablespace_name;</code><br>
				Note: If many users are logging on the same user account(app?), the will share use 
				of one temporary tablespace. This can be  a performance bottleneck, wich may 
				be avoided by using temporary tablespace groups.
			</li>
			<li>User profile</li>
			<li>Account status<br>
				in account_status column of dba_users whe have 5 possiiblities:
				<ul>
					<li>Open: account available for use
					</li>
					<li>Locked: This indicates that the dba deliberately locked the account.
							No user can connect to a locked account.
					</li>
					<li>Expired: This indicates that the password lifetime has expired. No user 
						can connect until the password is reset.
					</li>
					<li>Expired (Grace): the grace period is in effect. A password need not expire 
					immediately when its lifetime ends; it may be configured with a grace period during 
					wich users connecting to the account  have the opportunity to change the password.
					</li>
					<li>Locked(Timed): account locked because of failed login attempts. An acount can 
					be configured to lock automatically for a period after an incorrect password is 
					ppresented a certain number of times.
					</li>
				</ul>
				To lock an account: <code>alter user username account lock;</code><br>
				To unlock an account: <code>alter user username account unlock;</code><br>
				To force a user to change their password:
				<code>alter user username password expire;</code> This will immediately 
				start the grace period, forcing the user to change their password at their next 
				login attempt.
			</li>
			<li>Creating Accounts<br>
				The create user command has only two required arguments: a username and 
				a method of authentication. Optionally , it can accept a clause to specify default 
				tablespace and temporary tablespaces, one or more quota clauses, a named 
				profile and commands to lock the account and expire the password. Example:<br>
				<code>
					create user scott identified by tiger<br>
					default tablespace users temporary tablespace temp<br>
					quota 100m on users, quota unlimited on example<br>
					profile developer_profile<br>
					password expire<br>
					account unlock;<br>
				</code>
				This attriubutes can be modified later with alter user. Examples:<br>
				<code>
					alter user scott identified by lion;<br>
					alter user scott password expire;<br>
					...<br>
				</code>
				to drop the account: <code>drop user scott;</code> This command will 
				succeed only if the user does not own any object (schema empty). If you want 
				to drop the user and all the objects of the her schema, then: 
				<code> drop user scott cascade;</code><br>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>Grant And Revoke privileges<br>
	
		By default, no one can do anything in an Oracle database. A user cannot even connect 
		without being granted a privilege. Privileges are assigned to user accounts with GRANT 
		and withdrawn with revoke. Privileges come in two groups: system privileges, that perform 
		actions that affect the data dictionary, and object privileges, wich let users perform actions 
		that affect data.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>System Privileges<br>
				More than 200 system privileges. Most affect data dictionary such creating tables or 
				users. Others affect the database or the instance, such as crceating tablespaces, 
				adjusting instance parameter values, and stablishing a session. This is the most 
				commonly used privileges:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create session: lets the user connect.
					</li>
					<li>
						Restricted session: If database is started with STARTUP RESTRICT or adjusted 
						with alter system enable restricted session, only users with this privilege will be 
						able to connect.
					</li>
					<li>
						Alter database: Gives access to many commands necessary for modifying 
						physical structures.
					</li>
					<li>
						alter system: gives control over instance parameters and memory structures
					</li>
					<li>
						create tablespace:used along with the alter tablespace and drop tablespace privileges;
						these privileges will let a user manage tablespaces.
					</li>
					<li>	
						Create table: lets the grantee create tables in his own schema; includes alter, drop 
						, select and others DML on them and to create, alter or drop indexes on them.
					</li>
					<li>
						Grant any object privilege:lets the grantee grant object permissions on all objects, 
						including those he does not own, to others (but not himself).
					</li>
					<li>
						Create any table: the grantee can create tables that belong to other users.
					</li>
					<li>
						Drop any table: the grantee can drop tables bolonging to any other users.
					</li>
					<li>
						Insert any table, update any table, delete any table: the grantee can execute 
						these dml commands against tables owned by all other users.
					</li>
					<li>
						select any table: the grantee can select from any table in the database, with one 
						provision: tables owned by SYS, including the data dictionary tables are not visible.
					</li>
				</ul>
				The syntax: <code>GRANT privilege [,privilege...] TO username;</code><br>
				Useful example if user involved in developing applications:<br>
				<code>grant create session, alter session, create table, create view, create synonym, 
				create cluster, create database link, create sequence, crecate trigger, create type, 
				create procedure, create operator to username;
				</code><br>
				To grant a privilege to a user in form that this second user can grant to a third user 
				you need to include a variation in the grant syntax: <code>grant create table to scoott 
				with admin option;</code> This final with admin option permit it.<br>
				Note: Revocation of a system privilege will not cascade (unlike revocation of an object 
				privilege).<br>
				Any third-parties that receive a permission will not be revoked if the "second-party"
				will be revoked the permission.<br>
				The ANY privileges give permissions against all relevant objects in the database.i.e.: 
				<code> grant select any table to scott;</code> will let scott query every table in 
				every schema on DB.
			</li>
			<li>Object Privileges<br>
				Gives the ability to perform select, insert, update and delete commands against tables 
				and related objects as well as to execute PL/SQL objects. These privileges do not exist 
				for objects in the user's own schema; if a user has the system privilege create table, they 
				can perform select and dml operations against the tables they create with no further 
				need for permissions.<br>
				Note: The ANY privileges, wich grant permissions against objects in every user account in 
				the database, are not object privileges the are system privileges.<br>
				The object privileges apply to different types of object: 
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr><td>Privilege</td><td>Granted On</td></tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr><td>Select</td><td>Tables, views, sequences, synonyms</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Insert</td><td>Tables, views, synonyms</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Update</td><td>Tables, views, synonyms</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Delete</td><td>Tables, views, synonyms</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Alter</td><td>Tables, sequences</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Execute</td><td>Procedures, functions, packages, synonyms</td></tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				The syntax is: <code>Grant privilege on schema.object to username [with grant option];</code><br>
				Variations include the use of ALL, which will apply all the permissions relevant to the type of 
				object, and nominating particular columns of views or tables: 
				<code>grant all on hr.regions to scott;<br>
					grant update(salary) on hr.employees to scott;
				</code><br>
				Note: Revocation of an object privilege will cascade (unlike revocation of a system 
				privilege).<br>
				Using with grant option let a user pass their object privilege on to a third party. Oracle 
				retains a record of who granted object privileges to whom; this allows a revoke of an 
				object to cascade to all those in the chain.
				
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Create and Manage Roles<br>
		Managing security with directly granted privileges works but can be a huge workload 
		(administering) and it's not possible to enable/disable the permissions. These problems 
		are solved with roles. A role is a bundle of system and/or ibject privileges that can 
		granted or revoked as a unit, and having been granted can be temporarily activated 
		or deactivated within a session.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating and Granting Roles<br>
				Roles are not schema objects: they aren't owned by anyone and therefore cannot 
				be prefixed with a username. However, they do share the same namespace as user 
				, then it's not possible to create a role with the same name as an already-existing user 
				(or viceversa). To create a role use:<code>Create role rolename;</code> then 
				grant privileges to the role with the usual syntax, including with admin or with 
				gran option, as desired.
			</li>
			<li>Predefined Roles<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Connect: this role exist only for backward compatibility.
					</li>
					<li>
						Resource: also for backward compatibility, this role can create both data 
						objects and  procedural objects(such as tables) .
					</li>
					<li>
						DBA:has most of the system privileges as well as several object privileges 
						and roles. Aby user granted DBA can manage virtually all aspects of the 
						database, except for startup and shutdown.
					</li>
					<li>
						select_catalog_role: has thousand of object privileges against data 
						dictionary objects, but no system privileges or privileges against user data. 
						Useful for junior administration staff who must monitor and report on the database 
						but not be able to see user data.
					</li>
					<li>
						scheduler_admin: has the system privileges necessary for managing the 
						scheduler job-scheduling service.
					</li>
					<li>
						public: is always granted to every database user account. It follows that if a 
						privilege is granted to public, it will be available to all users.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Enabling Roles<br>
				By default the roles when granted are enabled. This behavior can be modified by 
				making the role nondefault.How to see if is default the role?:<code>select * from 
				dba_role_privs where grantee='JON';</code> To change the default behavior use: 
				<code>alter user jon default role none;</code>. The basic command to enable 
				a role within a session is: <code>set role rolename</code> but if the role is 
				created with the syntax: <code>create role rolename identified using procedure_name;</code>
				 then the role can only be enabled by running the PL/SQL procedure nominated by 
				 procedure_name. This procedure can make any number of checks (check the ip subnet, 
				 permited hours, runs a particular user process(maybe not SQL*PLUS)...).
			</li>
			<li>Privilege Analysis<br>
				It's difficult to identify what privileges a user has and what privileges he actually uses, for 
				this reason , Oracle provides the Privilege Analysis mechanism.The flow is as follows: 
				<ol>
					<li>
						Define the scope of what should be analyzed: privilege usage throughout the 
						entire db; privileges used that were accessed through certain roles; privileges 
						used by particular applications.
					</li>
					<li>
						Start monitoring activity, allow users to work for a period. Stop monitoring.
					</li>
					<li>
						Generate reports.
					</li>
				</ol>
				The critical procedures are: dbms_privilege_capture.create_capture, 
				dbms_privilege_capture.enable_capture, dbms_privilege_capture.disable_capture, 
				dbms_privilege_capture.generate_result. <br>
				The critical views are: dba_used_privs,dba_unused_privs
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Create and manage profiles<br>
		A profile can be used to enforce a password. The default profile (applied by default to all users 
		, including SYS and SYSTEM) does very little.
		<ul>
			<li>Password profile limits:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Failed_login_attempts:number of consecutive errors on a password before the 
						account is locked.
					</li>
					<li>
						Password_lock_time: # of days to lock an account after failed_login_attempts is reached.
					</li>
					<li>
						Password_life_time: # of days before a password expires.
					</li>
					<li>
						Password_grace_time: # of days following the first successful login after the password 
						has expired during wich the password can be changed. The old password is still usable 
						during this time.
					</li>
					<li>
						password_reuse_max: # of password changes before a password can be reused.
					</li>
					<li>
						password_verify_function: the name of a function to run whenever a password is changed.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Note: Profiles can be also be used to limit resource usage, but a much more sophisticated tool 
				to accomplish this is the resource manager.<br>
				See wich profile is currently assigned to each user:<code>select username,profile from dba_users;</code><br>
				See the profiles:<code>select * from dba_profiles where profile='DEFAULT';</code><br>
				The default profile has these password limits:FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS:10,
				PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME:180 days, password_reuse_time:unlimited, 
				password_reuse_max:unlimited, password_verify_function:null, password_lock_time: 1 day, 
				password_grace_time:7 days.
			</li>
			<li>Creating and assigning profiles<br>
				The simplest way to enable more sophisticated password management is to run:
				 <code>$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlpwdmg.sql</code>
				 To create a profile use create profile command
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
