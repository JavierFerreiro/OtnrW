<h2>Create a DB</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Differences between Instance, Database and data Dictionary.
	<p>The instance is a composition of memory structures and processes in the 
	ram/cpu. If you shutting down the machine, all of this structures are lost. 
	Create an instance is nothing more than create the ram structures and the 
	differents process.<br>
	The instance is defined by an instance parameter file where it's defined 
	(among other things) how the instance should be built in memory and the
	behavior of the background processes.<br>
	After the instance is created, it is in a "no mount" mode. In this mode, the
	instance is created but has not connected to a database ( even maybe
	it's not created).<br>
	All the parameters must be defined either in the parameter file of the 
	instance or by the default value with the exception of the DB_NAME 
	parameter. This parameter names the database to wich the instance 
	will connect. This parameter is also embedded in the controlfile.	<br>
	The parameter control_files tells the instance the location of the 
	controlfile. When the instance read the controlfile (because knows
	the position thanks to control_files parameter),  if there is a mistmatch in
	 database names the database will not mount. In mount mode has succesfully 
	 connected to the controlfile. If the control file is damaged it's 
	 impossible to open the database.<br>
	 Withing the control file are pointers to other files: online redo log 
	 files and the data files.<br>
	 When the instance is in mounted state, it's possible to pass to the next
	  and the last stage: open that is, when the instance locate and open 
	  the database files. In the control files exist a mapping of the datafiles 
	  to tablespaces .
	</p>
	<p>The database is a set of files on disk. It persist if the machine is 
	shutting down. Create a database is did it for the instance as a once-off 
	and is inaccesible without an instance.
	</p>
	<p>Inside the database is a set of tables and other objects called the 
	data dictionary that describe all the logical and physical sctructures in 
	the db.This structures are in the SYSTEM tablespace
	</p>
	<p>Create a DB means create the minimum physical structures to 
	support the data dictionary and then create the data dictionary itself.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>To create a database server you must follow this steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Create the instance.
			</li>
			<li>Create the database.
			</li>
			<li>Create the data dictionary: is created by running a set of SQL 
			scripts that exists in the ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin. They are 
			called by CREATE DATABASE command. The first is sql.bsq and 
			this call several other scripts.
			</li>
			<li>Make the database usable: The database in this moment it's not 
			usable by humans because the structure is too abstruse. For resolve 
			this before use the database must be created a set of views and pl/sql
			 packages.For this need to be called all the cat* files that creates views and other objects.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Manually can do of this form:
			<ol>
				<li>
				Create a parameter file (optionally) and a password file.
				</li>
				<li>
				Use the parameter file to build an instance in memory.
				</li>
				<li>
				Issue the CREATE DATABASE command: This generate at minimum 
				a controlfile, two online redo logs files, one datafile each for  the 
				SYSTEM and for the SYSAUX tablespaces and a data dictionary.
				</li>
				<li>Run sql scripts to generate the Enterprise Manager database 
				express as well as any options (such Java).
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To do this automatically (maybe before execute review), you need 
			to do: 
				<ol>
					<li>create a little script in the session of the user that 
					create the database server:<br>
					<code>
					export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0<br>
					export ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle<br>
					export ORACLE_HOME=${ORACLE_BASE}/product/12.1.0/dbhome_1<br>
					export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
					</code>
					</li>
					<li>Launch: <code>#dbca</code>
					</li>
					<li>Choose: Create database.
					</li>
					<li>Choose: Advanced Mode.
					</li>
					<li>Choose: Custom Database.
					</li>
					<li>The database must have a global database name, that 
					consist of a database name and optionally  a database 
					domain. The database name is embeded in the controlfile and
					 will be specified as the DB_NAME instance parameter and must
					  be unique in the server machine.<br>
					  The database name may be up to 8 characters long, including 
					  alphanumerics characters, "_", "#" and "$", but the first
					   character must be alphabetic.<br>
					   The database domain may be up 128 characters long, 
					   including alphanumerics and the "#". Dots may be used as
					    separators. The instance parameter is DB_DOMAIN. Is like
						the  fqdn of tcp networks and could be constructed like this, 
						but there is not relationship between them.<br>
						The second parameter in this point is the SID, that is 
						the name of the Oracle instance to be created, used in 
						the ORACLE_SID parameter. There is no reason for 
						this be the same as the DB_NAME but for the sake of 
						your sanity you will keep the same. It must be unique 
						in the database server machine.
					</li>
					<li>Choose EM database Express
					</li>Sys is the schema that owns the data dictionary itself,
					and the  password is written out to the external  password 
					file.<br>
					The system schema is really just a user  like any other, but 
					it is given  many  powerful  privileges.
					<li>Create a new listener with name and port (the default 
					port is 1521).
					</li>
					<li>Configure the place where life the database. If the 
					option is filesystem I personally like the large database 
					syntax. /u02/oradata and /u02/fast_recovery_area
					</li>
					<li>Select the components in function of the license and 
					requirements. If it's desired include the schema examples.
					</li>
					<li>In this step, you can choose the parameters of the 
					database. The DB_BLOCK_SIZE  is critical because is the only one  
					parameter that can never be changed after database creation(db_name could be changed with DBNEWID utility)
					The default value are 8K and  the legal values are 
					2k,4k,8k, 16k and on some platforms 32k.<br>
					The best option for database character is AL32UTF8.
					</li>
				</ol>
		</p>
		<p>Characteristics of dbca
			<ul>
				<li>The initialization parameter file is created by dbca in 
					order to start the instance and create the database. The 
					file normally is in $ORACLE_BASE/admin/db_name/scripts/init.ora.
				</li>
				<li>dbca permit create templates. For create one you need use an
				already create one or use an existing database to use as model
				(you can decide if wants only the structure or structure+data).
				Basically a template it's a rman backup.<br>
				The underlaying storage for a template is from files in the 
				ORACLE_HOME/assistants/dbca/templates
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>Other important things:
		<p>To know what options are installed in a database, connect to it and 
		execute:<code>select comp_name,version,status from dba_registry;</code>
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
