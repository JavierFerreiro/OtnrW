<h1>Basic Entrance and Representation of Data</h1>
<p>
In this chapter we addres about how a user can introduce data in the simpliest
 form, the keyboard, and how that's data will be representated in the terminal.
</p>

<h2>The console</h2>
<p>
The console it's "a place" where the basic interaction between humans and 
computer take place. This interaction it's in the most basic form posible,
the human use a keyboard to introduce data and the computer respond on screen. 
 Most advance forms of interactions was developed like the graphicals 
environments (with mouse and recently popularized systems like kinect, eye toy,
etc., but the old couple of screen and keyboard continues to be one of the 
most efficients and fasters.

<h2>The linux console</h2>
<p>The linux console it's the implementation that was started by Linus Torvalds
 for the linux kernel. During his life was developing new characteristics and
new implementatios. We try to look in depthm first analyzing differents and
less used consoles of linux and finally focus on the most used, the linux 
virtual console.

<h3>USB serial port </h3>
<h3>Braile Console </h3>
<h3>Serial Console</h3>
<h3>Virtual Console</h3>
<p>
 The virtual console also know as virtual terminal it's in a nutshell the 
classical "device"(you know, virtual devices), that we use to interact with
 linux. When you enter in a linux system without a graphical environment, you
can see the system asking for a username and password. That's the virtual 
console.

<h4>How it works</h4>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>The virtual console is a subsystem inside the linux kernel, concretely the 
VT system. Basically it takes a traditional console, the visual part: screen,
 and the entrance of data (keyboard) and multiplexe this for simulate 
differents consoles (virtual consoles), of course all of them manipulates with 
the same keyboard and screen.</p>
<p>
 The virtual console is formed The core of the console and the know as tty line discipline. This two systems 
speak with one console driver, who is in
charge, to dialog with the driver screen (frame buffer for example) and the 
keyboard driver.
