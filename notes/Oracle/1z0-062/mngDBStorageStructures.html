<h1>Managing Database Storage Structures</h1>
<p>Users of DB never see datafiles only logical segments. System 
	Administrators only see datafiles. Oracle database provides complete 
	abstraction between physical storage and logical storage because is a 
	requirement of the relational database paradigm.<br>
	A DBA must know all of the two worlds.

	<li>Describe the Storage of Table Row Data in Blocks<br>
		<ul>
			<li>The Oracle Data Storage Model.<br>
				If programmers are affected by physical changes, a simply 
				change of name of the file break the program. If you separeted 
				the logical from the physical you can change files, run on 
				different hardware and O.S and the program will not be 
				affected. Remember the "entity-relationship" diagram of the 
				storage.<br>
				<img src="img/storageModel.png" alt="storageModel.png"/><br>
				Why the segment (I think could be used as synonym of table or 
				index or...) is not directly related with datafiles? Because the 
				relationship will be many-to-many (that the relational model try 
				to avoid, think that a segment could be in many datafiles and in 
				a datafile could be different segments. If not, for example, you 
				relation a segment (like a table) directly with a datafile you're 
				broken the relational model, linking the physycal space with the 
				logical space.<br>
				To resolve this we use the tablespace that can contain many 
				segments and be made up of many datafiles, but one datafile 
				could stay in one tablespace only and onse segment could be in 
				one tablespace only. Then one segment could be spread accross 
				multiple datafiles and any one datafile may contain all of or parts 
				of many segments. The tablespaces are identified by a unique 
				name. <br>
				The segment entity represents any database object that stores 
				data and therefore requires space in a tablespace. The typical 
				segment is a table (or index segment or undo segment...). 
				Segments are schema objects, identified by the segment name 
				and qualified with the owning schema object. Note that 
				programmatic schema objects (PL/SQL procedures, views or 
				sequences) are not segments: they do not store data, and they 
				exist as structures within the data dictionary.<br>
				The oracle block is the unit of I/O for the database. Datafiles 
				are formatted into Oracle blocks, consecutively numbered. The 
				size of the block is fixed by for a tablespace (default 8KB). The 
				size can range from 2KB to 16KB in windows/linux (in some 
				other O.S. 32KB). The block size is controlled by the parameter 
				DB_BLOCK_SIZE. This can never be changed after database 
				creation because it is used to format the datafile that make up 
				the SYSTEM tablespace. <br>
				Note: The DB_BLOCK_SIZE is set at database creation and can 
				never be changed.<br>
				A block is uniquely identified by its number within a datafile: the 
				block number alone is not enough.<br>
				Managing space one block at a time would be a crippling task, 
				so blocks are grouped into extents. A extent is a set of consecutively 
				numbered Oracle blocks within one datafile. Every segment will 
				consist of one or more extents, also consecutively numbered. These 
				extents may be in any and all of the datafiles that make up the 
				tablespace. An extent can be identified from either the dimension 
				of the segment (extents are consecutively numbered per segment, 
				starting from zero) or the dimension of the datafile (every extent 
				is in one file, starting at a certain Oracle block number).<br>
				A datafile is, physically, made up  of a number of O.S. blocks.<br>
				The alternative to file systems for datafile storage are raw devices 
				or ASM. Raw devices are no longer supported by Oracle for datafile 
				storage.

			</li>
			<li>Segments, Extents, Blocks and Rows<br>
				dba_segments view describe every segment in the database.<br>
				Segments types:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Table: heap-structured tables of variable-length rows in 
					random order. Never forget that the table is not the segment 
					and that there are more complex table organizations that that 
					use other segments types.
					</li>
					<li>Index: sorted lists of key values, each with a pointer, the 
					ROWID, to the physical location of the row. The ROWID specifies 
					wich Oracle block of wich datafile the row is in, and the row number 
					within the block.
					</li>
					<li>Type2undo: the undo segments (no one refers to them as 
					type2undo segments) store the prechange versions fo data 
					necessary for providing transactional integrity: rollback , read 
					consistency and isolation.
					</li>
					<li>Table Partition: A table can be divided into many partitions. 
					If this is done, then the partitions will be individual segments and 
					the table itself will not be a segment at all. These segments can 
					be in different tablespaces, meaning that it becomes possible 
					to spread one table across multiple tablespaces.
					</li>
					<li>Index Partition: Indexes can be partitioned. If you are 
					partitioning your tables, you will usually partition the 
					indexes on those tables as well.
					</li>
					<li>Lobsegment, Lobindex, Lobpartition: If a column is defined 
					as a large object data type, then only a pointer is stored in the 
					table itself: a pointer to an entry in a separate segment where 
					the column data actually resides. LOBs can have indexes built 
					on them for rapid acces to data within the objects, and LOBs 
					can also partitioned.
					</li>Cluster: segment that contain several tables. In contrast 
					with partitioning, which lets you spread one table across many 
					segments, clustering lets you denormalize many tables into 
					one segment.
					<li>Nested table: If a column of a table is defined as a 
					user-defined  object type that itself has columns, then the 
					column can be stored in its own segment, as a nested table.
					</li>
					<li>Rollback: segments that should not be used in normal 
					running from 9i onward that introduced automatic undo 
					management wich is based on undo segments. There will 
					always be one rollback segment that protects the 
					transactions used to create a database (because at that point 
					no undo segments exist), but it shouldn't be used subsequently.
					</li>
				</ul>
				When a segment it's created, Oracle will allocate an extent to it. 
				When the extent is filled, Oracle create a second extent and so on. 
				If you know that a segment is going to need more space you can 
				manually allocate an extent.<br>
				How to create a table assign a extent immediatly and allocate new 
				one: 
				<br><code>create table scott.newtab(c1 data) segment 
				creation immediate;<br>alter table scott.newtab allocate extent;</code><br>
				To override the Oracle algorithm for decide what datafile use you 
				can use: <code>alter table tablename allocate extent storage (
				datafile 'filename');</code>
				An extent consist of a set of consecutively numbered blocks. Each block 
				will have a header area and a data area. The header is of a variable 
				size and grows downward, if necessary, from the top of the block. Among 
				other things, it contains a row directory (list where in the block each row 
				begins) and row locking information. The data area fills from the bottom 
				up. The block header grow with inserts and locking rows. The data area 
				is initially empty and fills as rows are inserted (or index keys in index 
				segment). The free space does get fragmented as rows are inserted, 
				deleted and updated but this is not important because all of this happens 
				in memory, after the block has been copied into a buffer in the database 
				buffer cache. The free space is coalesced into a contiguos area, when 
				necessary, and always before the DBWn writes the block back to its 
				datafile.<br>
			</li>
			<li>Create and Manage Tablespaces<br>
				Tablespaces are repositories for schema data, including the data dictionary 
				(SYS schema).<br>
				All databases must have a SYSTEM and SYSAUX tablespace as well as 
				(for practical purposes) a temporary tablespace and undo tablespace.<br>
				How to create a tablespace: with DBExpress or <br>
				<code>CREATE SMALLFILE TABLESPACE "PROVA" DATAFILE 
					'prova' SIZE 100M AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M
					LOGGING DEFAULT NOCOMPRESS ONLINE
					EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL AUTOALLOCATE
					SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;
				</code><br>
				SMALLFILE means that it can consist on one or many datafiles. With the 
				alternative BIGFLE it's impossible to add a second file. Autoextends means 
				that the datafile can grow automatically  on steps of 100M in this case. We 
				indicate that by default we want generate redo (with loggin default option).
				With "extent management local autoallocate" we indicate the use of bitmaps 
				fpr allocating extents and finally "segment space management auto" say 
				that will use bitmaps for tracking block usage.<br>
				Usual Operations in tablespaces:<br>
				<code>
				Create and manipulate tablespaces:<br>
				create tablespace prova
				datafile '/u02/oradata/cc/prova001.dbf' size 100m
				extent management local autoallocate
				segment space management auto;
				create table newtab(c1 date) tablespace prova;
				select extent_id, bytes from dba_extents where owner='SYS' and segment_name='NEWTAB';
				alter tablespace prova offline;
				alter table newtab allocate extent;
				alter tablespace prova read only;
				alter tablespace prova read write;
				drop tablespace prova including contents and datafiles;
				alter tablespace oldname rename to newname;
				</code>
				Change name to a Datafile:
				<code>
						alter tablespace XXX offline; or alter datafile '111' offline;<br>
						host<br>
						mv '1111' '2222'<br>
						(back to sqlplus)<br>
						alter database rename file '1110' to '222'<br>
						(maybe recover datafile '2222')<br>
						alter tablespace XXX online ; or alterl datafile '222' online;
				</code><br>
				The other option that make all in one statement, no downtime!!!:
				<code>
					alter database move datafile '111' to '222';
				</code><br>
				When put a tablespace offline you could do:<br>
				Alter tablespace tablespacename offline [normal|immediate|temporary];<br>
				A normal offline (default) will force a checkpoint for all the tablespace datafile.
				Immediate offline tablespace and his files  without flushing any dirty buffers. 
				Therefore will be needed a recover, applying change vectors from the redo log 
				before back online. Temporary offline will checkpoint all the files that can be 
				checkpointed and then take them and the tablespace offline in an orderly fashion. 
				Any damaged files will be offlined immediately.<br>
				When you mark a tablespace as read only you can delete,insert... in this tablespace, 
				but be carefully because you can drop objects.<br>
				Resizing tablespace: <code>alter database datafile '111' resize n[M|G|T]; </code>
				Add another datafile: <code>alter tablespace tbsname add datafile '/fdsf/111' size 2g;</code>
				Enable automatic extension: <code> alter database datafile '/asda/111' autoextend 
				on next 100m maxsize 4g;</code>
				With bigfile:<br>
				Create: <code> create bigfile tablespace tbsname datafile '/dadsd/sd' size 100m;</code><br>
				Resize: you could resize the tablespace directly because have only one datafile: 
				<code>alter tablespace tbsname resize 100m;</code><br>
				The different size between small files and big file: big file can manage up to 4 billion 
				block (4,000,000,000) and normal datafiles can manage up to 1022 datafiles everyone 
				of 4 million blocks = 4,088,000,000. The differences is "only" 88 millions of blocks (2,1% in 
				favor of small files)<br>
				Droppiong tablespace:
				<code>drop tablespace tbsname [including contents [and datafiles] ];</code><br>
				If Including contents are not specified, the drop will fail if there are any objects in the 
				tablespace, if included oracle drop the objects (although this could fail if a table is a 
				foreign key for other table in other tablespace). The "and datafiles" included to drop the 
				files too (at O.S. level), if not included, the files remain.

			</li>
			<li>Extent Management<br>
				The extent management method is set per tablespace and applies to all segments 
				in the tablespace. Exist 2 techniques: dictionary management or local management. 
				The difference is local management should always be used, dictionary management 
				never (holdover from the past versions). Dictionary management use 2 tables in 
				data dictionary: SYS.UET$ (used extents) and SYS.FET$ (free extents). Every time 
				the database needs to allocate an extent to a segment, it must search FET$ to search 
				free extensions, then carry out DML against FET$ and UET$ to allocate it to the segment. 
				This mechanism cause problems of performance because all operations in DB must 
				serialize on the code that constructs the transacion.<br>
				Local extent management was introduced in 8i and the default in 9i. It uses bitmaps 
				stored in each datafile. Each bit in the bitmap covers a range of blocks, and when space 
				is allocated the appropriate bits are changed from zero to one. This mechanism is more 
				efficient than the transaction-based of the dictionary management.<br>
				An important option when create a locally managed tablespace is uniform size. If uniform 
				is specified, then every extent ever allocated in the tablespace will be that size transforming 
				the space management in something highly efficient because the block ranges covered by 
				each bit (of the bitmap) can be larger: only one bit per extent.--> 
				<code>[...]extent management local uniform size 160m;</code> In this example the 
				extent more little has 160MB. With only one bit we assign 160MB, that is very efficient. The 
				problem is that a table has only a few rows with litte data the minimum extent that oracle 
				give to it is 160MB. Then is best to give a size more little: <code>[...] extent management 
				local uniform size 160k;</code>. The alternative is use autoallocate: 
				<code>[...]extent management local autoallocate;</code> This is the default. When a 
				segment needs a extent, the first time oracle allocate 8 blocks (normally 64KB) extent. As 
				a segment grows and requires more extents, oracle will allocate extents of this size up 
				to 16 extents. adter wich it will allocate 128-block (normally 1MB).<br>
				To convert a dictionary-managed tablespaces to local management you can use pl/sql 
				procedure call: 
				<code>execute dbms_space_admin.tablespace_migrate_to_local('tbsname');</code><br>
				It's a easy and quick procedure, except for a system tablespace that require 
				some extra steps.
			</li>
			<li>Segment Space management<br>
				The segment space management method is set per tablespace and applies to all segments 
				in the tablespace. There are two techniques: manual (shouldn't be used, holdover of past versions )
				and automatic  (should be used always). Automatic introduced in 9i and default in 11g. In 
				automatic, every segment has a set of bitmaps that describe how full each block is. There 
				are 5 bitmaps for each segment and each block will appear on exactly one bitmap. The 
				bitmaps tracks the space used in bands: there is a bitmap for full blocks and there are bitmaps 
				for blocks that are 75%-100% used, 50-75% used, 25-50% used and 0-25% used. When 
				searching for a block into which to insert a row, the session server process will look at 
				the size of the row to determine wich bitmap to search. For instance, if the block size is 4KB 
				and the row to be inserted is 1,500 bytes an appropiate block will be found by searching the 
				25-50% percent bitmap. Every block in this bitmaps is guaranted to have at least 2KB of 
				free space.<br>
				The old manual space management method used a simple list, know as the freelist, that 
				stated wich blocks were available for insert but without any information on how full they were, then 
				the blocks had to be tested for space at insert time. The only tablespaces that should be 
				use this old method are system,undo and temporary. This segments are managed by 
				Oracle and don't required assistance from any automatic mechanism.
			</li>
			<li>
				How is combined LMT and ASSM to control the blocks.<br>
				Every datafile has a initial header where is storaged the bitmap of the extensions, locally managed tablespace.
				Locally because every datafile has his own bitmap. This bitmap marks the extension of the datafile assigned or 
				not to a segment (therefore the blocks). But not say to what segment.
				In the data dictionary is storaged where is the header block of the segment: 
				<code>select segment_name,header_block from dba_segments where segment_name='T4';</code>
				 Then in the header block of the segment we have the bitmaps of the ASSM where is indicate the ocupation of the 
				 blocks. In the headers is storaged the HWM (high water mark) and the Low HWM (low high water mark). Under the Low high 
				 water mark are the blocks that are formated and with data ( a full scan read all the blocks below low HWM). Between 
				 low HWM and HWM are the blocks that are formated and without data and above the HWM are blocks that aren't formatted. 
				 
			</li>
			<li>Oracle Managed Files (OMF)<br>
				Use of OMF is intended to remove the necessity for the DBA to have any knowledge of the 
				file system. The creation of database files can be fully automated. To enable OMF, set some 
				or all of these instance parameters:<br>
				<code>
					DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST<br>
					DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_1<br>
					DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_2<br>
					DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_3<br>
					DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_4<br>
					DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_5<br>
					DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST<br>
				</code>
				The DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST parameter specifies a default location for all datafiles 
				and online redo logs files. The DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_n parameters 
				specify a default location for online redo log files taking precedence over 
				DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST. DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST set up a default localtion 
				for archive redo log files and recovery Manager (rman) backup files.<br>
				As well  as settinf default file locations, OMF will generate filenames and (by 
				default) set the file sizes. Once OMF has been enabled, it can always be overridden 
				by specifying a datafile name on the create tablespace command.<br>
				Example of activate OMF:<br>
				<code>
					alter system set db_create_file_dest='/u01/oradata';<br>
					create tablespace omfts;<br>
					select file_name, bytes, autoextensible, increment_by,maxbytes from 
					dba_data_files where tablespace_name='OMFTS';<br>
				</code>
			</li>
		</ul>
