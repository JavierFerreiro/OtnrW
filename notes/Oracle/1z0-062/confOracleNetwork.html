<h1>Configuring The Oracle Network Environment</h1>
<p>
Oracle net is the enabling technology for Oracle's client-server architecture. 
Whatever tool is used to configure the oracle net the result is the same, a 
set of files that control the database listener, that launch the server processes 
in response to connections requests
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Configure Oracle Net Service<br>
		Oracle client-server architecture uses the oracle net protocol to establish 
		and mantain the session between the client and the server. It's possible 
		to use without configuration, but in practice all sites configure it.<br>
		<ul>Concepts:<br>
			<li>Oracle Net and the Client-Server Paradigm<br>
				In Oracle no user has direct acces to database, all acces to 
				database is controlled by the server.<br>
				A user interact with a user process (software that the user 
				run locally: Acces with ODBC driver, C program linked with OCI
				, sqlplus...) . The purpose of the client process is launch the 
				sql of the user<br>
				The server process is a process running on the database server 
				machine that execute the SQL received from the user process.<br>
				This is the client-server split: user process generate sql and the 
				server process execute it.<br>
				Oracle net provides the mechanism for launching a server process 
				to execute code on behalf of a user process and return the results, 
				this is called establishing a session.<br>	
				<img src="img/session.png" alt="session"/>
				The protocols under Oracle Net and supported by it are: tcp/ip (
				 version 4 and 6 with and without SSL), Windows named pipes, 
				 and the sockets direct protocol (SDP) designed for infiniband 
				 and IPC internal of the O.S.<br>
			</li>
			<li>Establishing a Session<br>
				A user stablish a session with: <code> CONNECT scott/tiger@ORCL12C</code> 
				,composed by: database username (SCOTT),password (TIGER) separeted by the 
				delimiter (/). Then the symbol @ followed by the connect string. @ say to the 
				user process that a network connections is required. If @ and the connection 
				string is omited then the user process will assume that the instance where the user 
				wants to connect is on the local machine. If use @ the user process use a network 
				connection include if the remote machine is the local machine (the connection travel
				for the nic and return).
			</li>
			<li>Connectiong to a Local Instance<br>
				Even if the db server is local, you still use Oracle Net. All sessions use network 
				protocol to implement the separation of user code from server code, but for a 
				local connection the protocol is IPC. This is the only type of connection do not 
				require any configuration at all. The only information needed is to tell your 
				user process wich instance you want to connect to. This information is passed 
				through an environment variable ORACLE_SID.
			</li>
			<li>Name resolution<br>
				When connecting over a network the first stage is to work out exactly what is 
				you want to connect to. This process is known as name resolution. If your connect 
				statement includes the connect string (@orcl12c) Oracle Net needs to resolve 
				to protocol,ip address, port and the name of the instance (which noot need to 
				be the same as the connect string).
			</li>
			<li>Launching a Server Process<br>
				The database listener, running on the server machine monitors one or more ports 
				on one or more network interfaces cards for incoming connections request. 
				The listener first validate if the instance is available, if pass this control, the listener 
				will launch a new server process to service this user process.<br>
				In TCP each dedicated server process will acquire a unique tcp port. The port 
				number is passed back to the user process by the listener (on some O.S. the 
				socket already opened to the listeneris transferred to the new port number). 
				Now the user process can communicate directly with it's server process. The 
				listener has finisehed and waits for the next connect.
			</li>
			<li>Creating a Database Listener
				The definition file of the oracle listener is : ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora 
				As minimum listener.ora must include a section for one listener that states its name, 
				the protocol and the listening address it will use. It's possible to include  
				several listeners in the one file, but with different name and address.<br>
				Note: If the listener is not running  no new server processes can be launched 
				but this not affect any existing session.<br>
				If not exist the listener.ora file, the listener will be created with the defaults: 
				port 1521, name LISTENER and address the hostname. Tip: always configure 
				the listener.ora (self-documenting).
			</li>
			<li>Dynamic Service Registration<br>
				The listener needs to know what instances are currently running on the server. 
				It's possible to hardcode a list of instances in the listener.ora file but this is not 
				considered best practice. The best it's to rely on dynamic service registration.<br>
				Every database offers one or more services. A service is a logical name to which 
				sessions can attach, thorugh the instance. Different services within the 
				database can have different characteristics (for instance, for fault tolerance...).
				 There will always be a default service named after the database which is 
				 often the same name as the instance, wich is often the same name as the 
				 Net service alias defined in tnsnames.ora file and used in connect strings.<br>
				 When an instance starts by default look for a listener on the address to which 
				 the machine's hostname resolves using port 1521. If exist there a listener, 
				 the database will registers it's service names, when the database is 
				 shutdown, it will deregister itself from the listener.<br>
				 Note:It is the LREG background process that registers services with the 
				 the listener. during the lifetime of the instance, the LREG process repeat 
				 the registration process avoiding problems if the listener is stoppped and 
				 started.
			</li>
			<li>Shared Server<br>
				The network architecture that we saw is know as dedicated server. One 
				user process, one server process. An alternative is the shared server 
				architecture, where a relatively small pool of server processes services 
				a much larger number of user sessions.
			</li>
			<li>Limitations of Dedicated Server Architecture.<br>
				As more users log on to your instance, more server processes get launched 
				and this could produce problems with the speed of create it, make the context 
				switch (that are very expensive in cpu terms).<br>
				Mainframe systems could make context switches of tens of thousands of 
				processes without problems, but Uniz or Windows can have problems. 
				Problems with the memory can occurs too as more sessions are established.
				The actual server processes themselves are not an issue, because all 
				modern O.S. use shared memory when the same process is loaded more 
				than once, so launch thousands of processes no take more memory than 
				launch one. The problem comes with the PGA that is a block of memory 
				associated with each server process to mantain the state of the session ans 
				is a work area for operations such as sorting rows, then can't be shared memory 
				the data is unique to each session. To overcome this problems Oracle offer the 
				shared server architecture.<br>
				Note: In unix oracle server process are real processes, in windows are threads.
			</li>
			<li>The shared Server Architecture<br>
				Shared server is implemented purely on the server side, the user server have 
				no way of telling that anything has changed. The connection protocol is the same
				(listener,etc...) and the rest of the process.<br>
				Note: All is the same but the client can demand either a shared or dedicated 
				server specifying either SERVER=DEDICATED or SERVER=SARED in the TNS 
				connect string.<br>
				The implementation of shared server is did it with additional processes that are 
				part of the instance. They are launched at instance startup time. That are 2 
				processes types: dispatchers and shared servers. There are also some extra 
				queue memory structures within the SGA, and the listener modifies it's 
				behavior for shared server.<br>
				When an instance configured for shared servers start, it start one or more 
				dispatchers. The dispatchers run on a unique tcp port. They contact with the 
				listener and register with it. One or more shared server processes also start. 
				This shared servers receive SQL statements, parse and execute it. The SQL are 
				received from a queue that will be populated with statements from any 
				number of user process. Similarly, the results from shared server are send 
				to a response queue not directly to the user session. The process that are 
				in charge to put the sql from users process to SQL queue and in charge 
				to take the results from result queue and send to user process are dispatchers. 
				When a user process contacts a listener, this passes back the address of 
				a dispatcher (if exist multiple dispatchers, the listener will load-balance). 
				Each user processes is connected to one dispatcher (the user process thinks 
				that is a server process) that is shared with other user process.<br>
				Note:a sessions's connection to a dispatcher persists for the duration of the 
				session, unlike the connection to the listener, wich is transient.<br>
				When the user process issues a SQL statement, it sent to the dispatcher. 
				The dispatcher puts all the statements it receives onto a queue called 
				common queue (common because all dispatchers share it). All the shared 
				server processes monitor the common queue, when a statement arrives on 
				the common queue the first available shared server picks it up, in this moment 
				the execution is normal (parse, bind, execute), but when it comes to the fetch 
				phase the shared server puts the result set onto a response queue (the shared 
				server doesn't know nothing of the user process including the ip or port) that is 
				specific to the dispatcher that received the job in the first place. Each 
				dispatcher monitors its own response queue and whenever any results are put 
				on it, the dispatcher will pick them up and fetch them back to the user process 
				that originally issued the statement.<br>
				Note: There is a common input queue shared by all dispatchers, but each 
				dispatcher has its own response queue.<br>
				Then...How is possible to mantain the state of a session, for example, for 
				make a select for update, after a delete, after a update and finally the commit?
				In a dedicated server the state it's mantained in it's own PGA (that store: session 
				data, its cursor state, its sort space and its stack space). To store all of this 
				information in the shared server model, the shared servers does not retain 
				the session information, this information is in the SGA. Then whenever a 
				shared server picks a job off the common queue, it will go to the SGA and 
				connect to the appropriate block of memory to find out the state of the session.
				The area of memory used inside of the SGA is knowed as UGA (User Global Area) 
				that are allocated in the large pool and include all of the PGA except 
				the session's stack space. The list of session memory structures that is 
				stored in the SGA when shared server is implemented are: 
				<ul>
					<li>Sort area</li>
					<li>Hash area</li>
					<li>Bitmap creation area</li>
					<li>Bitmap merge area</li>
					<li>Cursor state</li>
					<li>User session data</li>
				</ul>
				Not implemented in the sga:
				<ul>
					<li>Stack space</li>
					<li>Local variables</li>
				</ul>
				It's impossible to use a shared server session to start up or shut down 
				the instance because the processes needed to support shared server 
				are themselves part of the instance.
			</li>
			<li>Configuring the Shared Server<br>
				In the client side it's not necessary a configuration. On the server side, 
				shared server is configured though instance initialization parameters (nothing 
				to do with the database because it's a thing controlled by the instance). The 
				listener receive the information through the dynamic registration. In the set of 
				parameters to configure the Shared server two are the usually necessary: 
				dispatchers and shared_servers. Shared_servers controls the number of 
				shared servers that will be launched at instance startup. The number for 
				shared_server should be set to the maximum number of concurrent request 
				you expect avoiding the use of the queue (that's means that the sql is 
				processed immediately). But if exist a sudden burst of activity, Oracle 
				will launch addiontional shared servers up to the value of max_shared_servers. 
				By default shared_servers is one if dispatchers are set, the default of 
				max_shared_servers is 1/8 of the processes parameter or 2 if processes 
				parameter is less than 24. The dispatchers parameter controls how 
				many dispatcher processes to launch at instance startup and how they 
				will behave. This is the only required parameter to enable the shared 
				servers. There are many options for dispatchers parameter but usually 
				two will suffice how many to start and what protocol should listen on: 
				<code>SQL&gt;alter system set dispatchers='(dispatchers=2)(protocol=tcp)';
				<br>SQL&gt;alter system shared_servers=20;</code>
				With other parameters you could modify the listener where is register 
				the dispatchers (default use local_listener parameter), the ports used,etc.
				The max_dispatchers parameter sets an upper limit to the number of 
				dispatchers you can start but unlike shared servers Oracle not start 
				extra dispatchers on demand.<br>
				Tunning the shared server is vital
			</li>
			<li>When to use the Shared Server<br>
				Using shared server increases scalability but perhaps at the cost of reducing 
				performance (if the statement are the last of the queue).  It also take 
				more CPU resources for the enqueuing and dequeuing activity. In practice: 
				Less tan 100 connections then dedicated servers,100-1000 connections think 
				about shared servers, more than 1000 maybe it's time to shared servers.
			</li>
			<li>The Default Shared Server Configuration<br>
				A 12c database instance will run shared server by default, but only for 
				connections through the XDB
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>Use Tools for Configuring and Managing the Oracle Network<br>
			For change the configuration of Oracle Network only exist three files to 
			change: 
			<ul>
				<li>listener.ora: server-side and define the operation of the database listener.
				</li>
				<li>tnsnames.ora: client-side used for name resolution. In the server exist 
					to facilitate running clients on the server machine.
				</li>
				<li>sqlnet.ora: optional file in the (client/server)-side with various defaults 
				that will affect all clients and listeners.
				</li>
			</ul>
			For configurate all the Oracle Net exist two graphical tools:
			<li>The Net Manager</br>
				To launch the Net Manager run netmgr.<br>
				The Net Manager has three branches. the Profile branch creates or edits 
				sqlnet.ora file (used for tracing of Oracle Net , enable certain name-resolution 
				methods). The service Naming branch is used to configure client-side name 
				resolution in the tnsnames.ora. The listener branch is used to configure 
				the database listeners in listener.ora file.
			</li>
			<li>The Net Configuration Assistant<br>
				To launch the Net Configuration Assistant run netca. More simple than Net
				Manager
			</li>
			<li>The listener Control Utility<br>
				ORACLE_HOME/bin/lsnrctl. Could run in cli or in his own shell. For all commands 
				you must specify the name of the listener, If it is not the default name of 
				LISTENER. <br>
				<code>lsnrctl status<br>lsnrctl start<br>lsnrctl stop</code>
			</li>
			<li>The TNS_ADMIN environment variable<br>
				If the files of the net configuration (tnsnames.ora,sqlnet.ora,listener.ora) not are 
				in the default path: ORACLE_HOME/network/admin because for example you have 
				differents database everyone with a different ORACLE_HOME, you need to change 
				the path for the net configuration files. If are so many installations or you are a client 
				and have hundreds of different database in different machines,etc. you need to change 
				the location. For this purposse use then environment variable TNS_ADMIN that specify 
				where are the Oracle Net configuration files: <code> export TNS_ADMIN=/whatever/...
				</code>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>Configure Client-Side Network<br>
			<li>
				The client side of oracle Net is sqlnet.ora (optional) and tnsnames.ora file. Oracle 
				provides four methods of name resolution: easy connect, local naming (more extended), 
				directory naming (best for large and complex installation) and external naming, 
				<ul>
					<li>Easy Connect Name Resolution <br>
						Requires no configuration but is limited to one protocol: TCP (the others methods 
						of resolution can use any of the other supported protocols: TCP with secure sockets, 
						Named Pipes...) neither advanced capabilities such as load balancing or connect-time 
						failover across different network routes. It's enabled by default and it's invoked with 
						the syntax: <code>SQL&gt; connect scott/tiger@jwvaio:1221/orclz</code> where 
						jwvaio is the hostname, 1521 the port (where a listener will response).
					</li>
					<li>Local Naming Name Resolution<br>
						The user supplies an alias known as an Oracle Net service alias in the connect 
						string that is resolved by a local file: the tnsnames.ora.<br>
						<code>orclz=(DESCRIPTION= (ADDRESS_LIST= (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL
						=TCP) (HOST=jwvaio) (PORT =1522)) CONNECT_DATA= (service_name=orclz) ))<br>
						test=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP) (PROTOCOL=TCP)
						(HOST=serv2.example.com)(PORT=1521)) (CONNECT_DATA=(sid=testdb)) ))</code><br>
						In this snippet we have 2 Oracle Net service aliases defined: orclz and test.<br>
						Note: There need be no relationship between the alias, the service name and the 
						instance name (normally the people use the same)
					</li>
					<li>Directory Naming and External Naming<br>
						Directory naming points the user toward an LDAP directory server to resolve aliases.
						Oracle provides an LDAP server (Oracle Internet Directory) as part of the Oracle 
						Application Server, but you can use others like Active Directory, IBM and Novell 
						. The fact that use a central server simplifies the mantain efforts (versus a local 
						file that you need to change in every host).<br>
						External naming is conceptually similar to directory naming but with third-party 
						naming service such NIS+, CDS...
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Testing Oracle Net Connectivity<br>
					tnsping accepts a connect string and then test it. It will show the name resolution 
					method used, the Oracle Net configuration files being read and the details for 
					resolve the string. This not test if the database is actually running only if a listener 
					is active.
				</li>	
				<li>How to register a service:<br>
					<code>
						<ol>
							<li>#sqlplus / as sysdba</li>
							<li>alter system set service_names=serv1 scope=memory;</li>
							<li>alter system set local_listener=new scope=memory;</li>
							<li>alter system register</li>
						</ol>
					</codel>
				</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
			
	</li>
	<li>Understant Database Resident Connection Pooling<br>
		Many applicationcs have a large number od sessions that may be very short lived 
		and may not log on/off in an orderly fashion like the web application. Web application 
		use connection pooling to manage this situation: the application server stablish a relatively 
		small number of persistent sessions and passes temporary use of them to users on 
		demand. Using the Database Resident Connection Pool (DRCP) is a technique for 
		implementing similar functionality for middle-tier for middle-tier software that cannot 
		do a connection pooling, such as some Apache-based products.<br>
		A DRCP is enabled by default, configured to launch a minimum of four server proceses, 
		up to a maximum of 40.Idle servers will be terminated after 300 seconds.<br>
		To use the DRCP with easy connect name resolution simply add :POOLED to the 
		end of the connect string: <code>sqlplus scott/tiger@jwvaio:1521/orclz:pooled</code> 
		or in the tnsnames.ora in the connect_data of the net service alias add server=pooled: 
		<code>(connect_data=(service_name=orclz)(server=pooled))</code> <br>
		Note: in the book say that is started automatically by Oracle but I need to execute:
		 <code>SQL&gt; EXECUTE DBMS_CONNECTION_POOL.START_POOL();</code><br>
		 Note:When would one use a Database Resident Connection Pool? When manu application 
		 server sessions connect to the same database schema, but use it for only short requests.
	</li>
	<li>Configuring Communication Between Databases<br>
		Oracle Net can be configurated for communications between databases 
		aka database links,i.e.: <code>create database link prodscott connect to fred 
		identified by perry using 'prod'</code>. The remote database is identified by 
		tnsnnames.ora connect string 'prod', it's stored in the local schema scott and 
		only scoot can use it. A statement like <code>select * from score@prodscott;</code>
		the session transparently connect with the remote database and run the query there. 
		The name resolution occurs on the server.
	</li>
	
</ul>
