<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<ul>
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------- -->
<li>Concepts and Terminology
<p>When an error occurs (doesn't mean of what kind: system, application, user...), an exception is raised. The control is transferred to the exception section of the current block. You can't return to the execution block that generate the exception, after process the exception section (if exist) the control is returned to the enclosing block if any or finish the program.</p>
<p><code>PROCEDURE &ltname&gt</br>IS</br>BEGIN</br>Execution section</br>EXCEPTION</br>WHEN &ltvalue_error&gt </br>THEN</br>Exception_treatment</br>END;</code></p>
<p>In general are 2 tyes of exceptions:System (defined by Oracle and usually raised by PL/SQL runtime) and Programmer-defined exception (specific to the application)</p>
<p>Unnamed or anonymous exception: a exception that has an error code and a description associated with it, but does not have a name that can be used in a RAISE statement ot in a exception handler</p>
<p>Named exception: a exception with name</p>
</li>
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------- -->
<li>Defining Exceptions
	<p>Oracle predefine thousands of exceptions assigning numbers and messages and a little subset has a name too. This assignment is made in STANDARD package (one of 2 default packages (the other is DBMS_STANDARD), the exceptions defined in this packaged could be referenced without including the package name as a prefix) and others... This exceptions cover internal or system-generated errors.</p>
	<p>When you  need to catch your own application problems ("negative balance in account"...),first you need to declare your own exception in the declaration section using the keyword EXCEPTION: <code>&ltexception_name&gt EXCEPTION;</code></p>
	<p>This "variables" can only be referenced in 2 ways: in a RAISE statement or in the WHEN inside the exception section.</p>
	<p>EXCEPTION_INIT is a pragma (compile-time command) used to associate a name with an internal error code, that is, associate a error of oracle to your own error. It appears in the declaration section and the exception named must have already been defined in that same block</p>.Once associate, you can raise that exception by name and write an explicit WHEN handler that traps the error.</p>
	<p><code>DECLARE</br>&ltexception_name&gt EXCEPTION;</br>PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(invalid_month,-1843);</br>BEGIN<br>...</br>EXCEPTION</br> WHEN invalid month THEN ...</code></p>
	<p>The error number of the pragma could be any number with this restrictions:<ul><li>It cannot be -1403 (one of the two error codes for NO_DATA_FOUND). If you want to associate your own named expection with this error you need to pass 100 to the EXCEPTION_INIT pragma</li><li>It cannot be 0 or any positive number besides 100.</li><li>It cannot be a negative number less than -1000000</li></ul></p>
	<p>It's recommended to centralize the usage of the EXCEPTION_INIT into a package.<code>CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE dynsql</br>IS</br>invalid_table_name EXCEPTION;</br>PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT (invalid_table_name,-903);</br>...</br></code>In the exception section in another packages of my own code:<code>WHEN dynsql.invalid_identifier THEN...</code></p>

	<p>Scope of an Exception:</ul><li>Named system exception: globally available</li><li>Named programmer defined exception: block wich are declared and all nested blocks. If the definition is in a package, the scope is every program whose owner has EXECUTE privilege on that package.</li><li>Anonymous system exceptions: handled via WHEN OTHERS section if they have a name the scope of that name is the same as that of the named programmer-defined exception.</li></li>anonymous programmer-defined exceptions: defined only in the call to RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR and then are passed back to the calling program.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Raising Exceptions
	<p>3 ways to raise an exception in your application:<ul>
		<li>DB raise it when detects an error.</li>
		<li>You raise an exception with RAISE statement.
			<p>with RAISE statement you can raise your own exception or a system exception.</p>
			<p>Syntax:<code>RAISE exception_name;</code> or <code>RAISE package_name.exception_name;</code> or <code>RAISE;</code></p>
			<p>The third form: RAISE; is used to propagate out the same exception</p>
		</li>
		<li>You raise an exception with RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR built-in procedure.
			<p>Used to raise application-specific errors in your application. The difference with RAISE command is that you can associate an error message with the exception.</p>
			<p>When used all the changes made to OUT or IN OUT arguemnts are reversed, changes made to global data structures (INSERTS, UPDATES, package variables...) not be rolled back.</p>
			<p>Header: PROCEDURE RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR( num binary_integer, msg varchar2, keeperrorstack boolean default FALSE);</p>
			<p>Where num is the rror number and must be a value between -20,999 and -20,000.</br>msg is the error message and must be no more than 2000 characters.</br>keeperrorstack indicates if you want to add the error to any already on the stack.</p>
		</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Handling Exceptions
	<p>To handle or trap an exception you must write an exception handler for the exception in the excetpion section.</p>
	<p>The syntax is: WHEN &ltexception_name [OR exception_name...]&gt</br>THEN</br>executable statements...</br>[ WHEN OTHERS </br>THEN</br>executable statemnts</p>
	<p>WHEN clause traps errors only by exception name, not by error codes</p>
	<p>Note: Remember for capture a numeric error that has no name, the only way is capture in the WHEN OTHERS (inside exception section) or associate a name with the PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT</p>

	<p>If you don't want to loose error information, if you declare a programmer-defined exception inside a internal block. That block needs to has the appropiate WHEN for this exception, if not the exception will be propagated, but the declaration is in the internal block, then the information is not in the scope and are displayed in a generic form "error 1: user defined exception"</p>
</li>
<li>Built-in Error Functions
	<p>sqlcode(); : Returns the error coe of the most recently raised exception in your block.Return 0 if you call outside an exception handler.</p>
	<p>SQLERRM a funtion that returns the error message for a particular error code. Oracle recommends use DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_ERROR_STACK</p>
	<p>DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_ERROR_STACK returns the message associated with the current error. Return a error message more large but you can't put a number</p>
	<p>DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_ERROR_BACKTRACE: display the stack of programs and line numbers leading back to the line on wich the error was originally raised.</p>
	<p>DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_CALL_BACKTRACE: Like the previous but not limited only in case or errors: when you call it return the stack of calls up to the this function.</p>

	<p>If you want that a procedure (or function) continue even if a error is raised by one of the dml you must enclose all the dml in his own block,i.e.:<code>PROCEDURE change_data Is </br>BEGIN</br>DELETE FROM employees WHERE...;</br>EXCEPTION</br>WHEN OTHERS THEN log_error;</br>END;</br>BEGIN</br>UPDATE company SET...;</br>EXCEPTION</br>WHEN OTHERS THEN log_error;</br>END;</br>BEGIN</br>INSERT InTO company_history SELECT * FROM company WHERE...;</br>EXCEPTION</br>WHEN OTHERS THEN log_error;</br>END;</br>END;</code></p>

	<p>Note: activate warnings in compilation: ALTER SESSION SET plsql_warnings = 'enable:all'</p>
