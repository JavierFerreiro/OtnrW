<h1>Virtualization</h1>

<p>For virtualization we understand the capacity of simulate a complete 
hardware environment with the purpose of running in this fake machine 
a complete OS.
</p>

<p>
How to achieve it?In the following sections we consider the three main 
strategies followed for execute code of the guest OS (the virtualized)
on the host.
</p>

<h2>Actors of the Virtualization</h2>
<p>
First, we present the actors of the virtualization performance. This will be a
brief presentation, when we present de diferents kinds of virtualization we can
dive deeper in all of this.
</p>

<dt>the virtual machine monitor(vmm)</dt>
	<dd>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>The vmm is a piece of software that runs between the real hardware and the 
				virtual machines. It's function is abstract the hardware and present a set of 
				services to the guest os. This kind of services could be considerated an 
				abstract machine.
				</p>
				<p>In the figure you can see the differents privileged rings of a cpu and
				what kind of software/hardware are inside of each one of them. The arrows
				in the picture will be explained in the next sections.

<h2>Techniques virtualization</h2>

<h3>Direct execution</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>Transparent virtualization refers to the strategy of do nothing :). Some 
			pieces of code of the virtual machine don't represent a threat for the host,
			then, why we need to do something? Imagine that the guest os need to add 2 + 2.
			If the architecture is the same of the virtual guest you can transfer the code
			safely to the host's cpu and solve the problem.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sounds strange mention this, but the main part of the code is like this.
			The question is: what kind of operations are potentially dangerous?Imagine
			a kernel operation of the guest where try to access to a part of the memory
			that is taken for another process of the host. The guest could
			arrive at privileged information. The same thing can succes whith the acces
			of a hard disk, network interface...

<h3>Binary Translation</h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>
		What we can do when the operations are not directly executed in the processor?
		The first of the techniques, the most easy of implement and the most 
		inefficient is the binary translation.
		</p>
		<p>
		The binary translations lies in present to the virtual machine a full 
		representation of the hardware. All the virtual machines has a virtual bios,
		virtual memory, virtual devices,etc.
		</p>
		<p>
		When the virtual machine mades a privilegied call, it's made to one of the
		virtual devices presented (memory,i/o...), then is catched for the vmm and 
		translated (dynamically) for be executed for the hardware. The translation
		isn't a simple change of language (in fact, that's no simply), the vmm check
		other important things like security facts: the virtual machine has granted
		acces to the device? 
		</p>
		<p>
		In the figure you can see the binary translation in the left side (black 
		arrow). First, the user app of the virtual guest makes a request. That 
		request cause the intervention of the guest kernel, because, for example,
		wants acces to the secondary storage (hard disk). The guest kernel will
		try to execute operations that could be dangerous, but before this could be
		happend the vmm take the control, translate the instructions (with all of the
		security checks and more) and execute the code. The result is returned to the
		kernel of the guest os like the instruccion was executed.

<h3>Paravirtualization</h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>
		Paravirtualization is a technique based on the modification of the OS guest.
		In the bynary translation the guest OS, in some cases, need to be translated,
		this jobs is hard and produce delay. The base for paravirtualization is to 
		change the dangerous calls of the guest OS for calls to an api of the vmm.
		This calls are know as hypercalls. Some manafucaturers are trying to make a 
		standar in linux for the hypercalls api. Because you call direclty and api,
 		the improve of the performance is considerable respect a binary translation.

<h3>Hardware Support for virtualization</h3>
<p></p>
<h2>Kinds of Virtualization</h2>
<h3>Full Virtualization</h3>
<p>
The full virtualization is the addition of the direct execution plus binary 
translation. With this kind of virtualization you don't need a special Hardware
(Virtualization extensions of the cpu), or modify the guest OS. It's the most
easy kind of virtualition for migrate the virtual machine, don't depend of the 
hardware of the target machine, only that the software installed. On the other 
hand it's the slowest kind of virtualization.
