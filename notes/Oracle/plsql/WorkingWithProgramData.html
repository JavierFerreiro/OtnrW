<h2>Working With Program Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overview of PL/SQL Datatypes
	<p>We can categorized the variables with 3 "adjectives" and his oppossed: <ul><li>Variable/constant: the variables can change during program execution, the constants no.</li><li>Scalar/composite:Scalars are made up of a single value, cmoposite has multiple values, such records,collections,object...</li><li>Containerized:has not an opposite. Contain information obtained from database or data that was never in db and might not ever end up there.</li></ul></p>
	<p>Remeber the rules for naming variables:<ul><li>Up to 30 characters</li><li>Must start with a letter</li><li>After first letter could use:letters,numerals,$,# and _</li><li>All names are case insensitive unless are placed in double quotes (with double quotes you can by pass all these rules except 30 characters length)</li></ul></p>
	<p>Character Data: pl/sql support fixed (CHAR and NCHAR)  and variable-length strings (VARCHAR2 and NVARCHAR2) as traditional character and Unicode character. For very large character strings we have CLOB and NCLOB.</p>
	<p>Numbers: NUMBER has been the workhorse of the numeric datatypes. You can use it for decimal fixed and floating-point values and for integers.</br><code>salary NUMBER(9,2); -- fixed-point</br>raise_factor NUMBER; --Decimal floatting-point</br>weeks_to_pay NUMBER(2); -- integer</code></br>Oracle 10g and forward has another 2 binary floating-point types: BINARY_FLOAT and BINARY_DOUBLE (supported in pl/sql and db).This types gives a tremendous performance gains when used correctly. In oracle 11g entry 2 more variations of this floating-points types: SIMPLE_FLOAT and SIMPLE_DOUBLE, are like the 2 prevous but without null values and no raise exception when overflow occurs. PL/SQL support 2 types more that aren't supported by the DB,PLS_INTEGER and SIMPLE_INTEGER that has a very good performance (work directly in hardware if available). </p>
	<p>Dates,Timestamps and Intervals: Prior oracle9i only exist DATE wich stores date and time with second precision. In 9i was introduced INTERVAL and TIMESTAMP to work more precisse and confortable</p>
	<p>Booleans: PL/SQL support 3 values for booleans: TRUE,FALSE,NULL.</p>
	<p>Binary data: unstructured data that is not interpreted or processed by oracle, include RAW (like varchar2 but oracle do not perform character set conversion),BLOB and BFILE(store the data in operating system files, outside of the db). LONG RAW is "deprecated" don't use it.</p>
	<p>ROWID:2 propietary datatypes, ROWID (represents the unique physical address of a row) and UROWID (represents the logical position of a row in an index-organized table, IOT).</p>
	<p>REF CURSOR: allows developers to declare cursor variable, used tiwh static or dynamic SQL statements.REF CURSOR has 2 forms the weak (one of the few dynamically typed) and the strong.</p>
	<p>Beginning with 9i oracle has native support for XML and URIs with: DBUri-REFs. XMLType allows to query and store xml data and use native operators in the SQL language to search in XML using XPath. The URIType and HttpURIType can be used to store URLs to external web pages and files.</p>
	<p>"Any" datatypes:introduced in 9i, they let you dynamically enapsulate and access type description,data instances and sets of data instances of any other SQL type. Any datatypes has methods. Sum up, are objects.3 are the members of this datatype: AnyType, AnyData and AnyDataSet.</p>

	<p>User-Defined datatypes: thats all.</p>
</li>
<li>Declaring Program Data
	<p>With few exceptions, you must declare your variables and constants before use them, in the deaclaration section.</p>
	<p>Declaring a Variable</br>Syntax: name datatype [NOT NULL] [ := | DEFAULT default_assignment];</br> If you declare a variable NOT NULL then you must assign a value in the declaration.</br>The DEFAULT syntax and the assignment operator are equivalent</p>
	<p>Declaring Constants</br>Syntax: name CONSTANT datatype [NOT NULL]:=|DEFAULT default_value;</p>
	<p>The clause NOT NULL avoid that in the execution of the program could do this: &ltvariable_not_null&gt:=NULL;</p>
	<p>Anchored Declarations: instead of use a normal type like varchar2(100) you can "anchor" your variable to the structure that is the source of the data received (like a table of the db or another pl/sql) structure.PL/SQL offer 2 types of anchoring: scalar(%TYPE) and record anchoring (%ROWTYPE).</br>Syntax: &ltvariable_name&gt type_attribute%TYPE [optional_default_value_assignment];</br>&ltvariable_name&gt &lttable_name&gt | &ltcursor_name&gt%ROWTYPE [optional_default_value_asignment];</br>Anchoring is resolved in compile time. When you declare a NOT NULL variable in pl/sql if an anchor variable derived from this was used, then this must have a default value to respect the origin not null. If the origin is db this is not mandatory.</p>
<li>Programmer-defined Subtypes
	<p>With SUBTYPE statement you can define your own subtypes or aliases of predefined datatypes (sometimes referred as abastract datatypes). There are 2 kinds of subtypes: constrained and unconstrained. Constrained restrict the values normally allowed by the datatype.i.e.: <code>SUBTYPE POSITIVE IS BINARY_INTEGER RANGE 1 .. 2147483647;</code></br>Unconstrained does not restrict the values, in other words, an alias,i.e.: <code>SUBTYPE big_string IS VARCHAR2(32767);</code></p>
</li>
<li>Conversion Between Datatypes
	<p>you can perform conversion between datatypes in two forms: implicitly (make it by runtime engine to take its "best guess" at performing the conversion) or explicitly (calling a pl/sql function or operator to do the conversion).</p>
	<p>CHARTTOROWID: specification: <code> FUNCTION CHARTOWORID (string_in IN (varchar2|char) ) RETURN ROWID</code>. Convert a string of either type CHAR or VARCHAR2 to a value of type ROWID. The string must be an 18 character length of the format: OOOOOFFFBBBBBBRRR where OOOOO is the data object number, FFF is the relative file number, BBBBBB is the block number in the file and RRR is the row number within the block. All four numbers must be in base-64 format.</p>
	<p>ROWIDTOCHAR: the opposite of the previous</p>
	<p>CAST: Converts from one (and almost any) built-in datatype or collection-type value to another built-in datatype value.e.g: <code>DECLARE</br>hd_display varchar2(30);</br>BEGIN</br>hd_display:=CAST( SYSDATE as VARCHAR2);</br>END;<br></code></p>
	<p>CONVERT:converts strings from one character set to another character set.</br>Specification: FUNCTION CONVERT (string_in IN VARCHAR2,new_char_set VARCHAR2,[, old_char_set VARCHAR2]) RETURN VARCHAR2</br> If the third parameters is not specified then the default database character set is used.</p>
	<p>HEXTORAW: converts a hexadecimal string from type CHAR or VARCHAR2 to RAW.<br>Specification: FUNCTION HEXTOROW (string_in IN (CHAR|VARCHAR2))) RETURN RAW.</p>
	<p>RAWTOHEX: the opposite of the previous funcion</p>
