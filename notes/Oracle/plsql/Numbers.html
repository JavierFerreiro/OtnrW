<ul>
<li>Numeric datatypes
<ul><li>NUMBER
	<p>True decimal datatype ideal for working with monetary amounts. The only one of PL/SQL's numeric types to be implemented in a completly platform-independent fashion (work in all platforms).</p>
	<p>Syntax: x NUMBER;</br>It declares a floating-point NUMBER allocating spaces for 40 digits, decimal will float to best accommodate whatever value you assign</p>
	<p>Range:10<sup>-130</sup> up to 10<sup>126</sup>. Less than the limit will be rounded to 0. More than the limit will be converted in undefined.</p>
	<p>Exceptions: if you assign a number too much larger to a NUMBER it will raise a exception, but is the result of a calculation it will do that is described above but don't raise a exception</p>
	<p>If you want yo constraint a precision and scale: NUMBER(precision,scale);</br>This expression result in a fixed-point number. Precision=total number of digits, scale= number of digits to the right or left of the decimal point (depends of the sign of scale), positive sign count from right. When the scale is greater than precision,i.e.: NUMBER(9,11) then the result is 0.00999999999 that means that you can't represent a number grater than 0.01 (then, your numbers are in the range of 0.009 or less). The effect of a negative scale, NUMBER(9,-11), that is a number format like: 99999999900000000000, then the littest number you can represent is 100,000,000,000, e.g.: 150,000,975,230,001 -&gt; 150,000,000,000,000</p>
	<p>Working with fixed-point numbers you are limited to 38 significat digits(scale).</p>
   </li>
   <li>PLS_INTEGER
	<p>Integer conforming to your hardware's underlaying integer representation. Arithmetic is performed using hardware native machine instructions. You cannot store values of these type in the database. Faster than NUMBER</p>
	<p>Range:-2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647</p>
   </li>
   <li>BINARY_INTEGER
	<p>Allows store signed integers in binary format. The same that for PLS_INTEGER. Atention, is a "deprecated" data type, now is the same as PLS_INTEGER, avoid it.</p>
   </li>
   <li>SIMPLE_INTEGER
	<p>Introduced in 11g, same range that PLS_INTEGER, but does not allow NULL and does not raise an exception if overflow. Faster than PLS_INTEGER for natively compiled code.</p>
   </li>
   <li>BINARY_FLOAT and BINARY_DOUBLE
	<p>Introduced in 10g, single and double precision IEEE-754 binary floating-point types. Don't recomended for monetary amounts, useful for fast floating-point arithmetic.</p>
	<p>Implemented by PL/SQL and database engine itself (usable in tables)</p>
	<p>Range: BINARY_FLOAT:3.40282347E+38F -- 1.17549435E-38F BINARY_DOUBLE:1.7976931348623157E+308 and 2.2250748585072014E-308</p>
	<p>To write literals of these new types, you apply a suffix: f or d.</p>
	<p>LITERALS: BINARY_FLOAT_NAN,BYNARY_DOUBLE_NAN,BINARY_FLOAT_INFINITY, BINARY_DOUBLE_INFINITY, BINARY_FLOAT_MIN_NORMAL,bINARY_FLOAT_MAX_NORMAL,BINARY_FLOAT_MON_SUBNORMAL, BINARY_FLOAT_MAX_SUBNORMAL</P>
	<p>Predicates to work with this datatypes: IS NAN,IS NOT NAN,IS INFINITE,IS NOT INFINITE.</p>	
	<p>Don't use when require exact decimal representation.</p>
   </li>
   <li>SIMPLE_FLOAT and SIMPLE_DOUBLE
	<p>Introduced with 11g, same range as BINARY_FLOAT and BINARY_DOUBLE, but without NULL and overflow errors. Do not support special literals or predicates. Fasters than BINARY_FLOAT and BINARY_DOUBLE</p>
   </li>
   <li>Numeric subtypes
	<p>The rest of numeric datatypes are numeric subtypes that's mean, an alias with more or less restrictions (or without restrictions) to make directly compatible oracle with ansi sql or some other vendors(IBM)</p>
   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Number Conversions
<ul><li>TO_NUMBER
	<p>This function converts both fixed and variable length strings as well as IEEE-754 floating-point types to the NUMBER datatype using an optional format mask.</p>
	<p>Syntax:TO_NUMBER(string,[,format[,nls_params]]). Where string is a string or BINARY_DOUBLE expression. Format specifies how should be interpret the character representation.nls_params is used to override your current session-level NLS parameter setting.</p>
	<p>You can use TO_NUMBER without a format when: Your number is represented using only digits and a single decimal point. Any sign is leading and must be either minus or plus.Scientific notation is used(1.25E2).</br>To use the format mask review <a href="FunctionsSheet">this page</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>TO_CHAR
	<p>Converts numbers to ther character representation.</p>
	<p>Syntax: TO_CHAR(number [,format [,nls_params]])</br>number: the number to transform (could be any of th pl/sql numeric types)</br>format: the same format mask than in to_number <a href="FunctionSheet">(here)</a></br>nls_param: specifies a nls param different from the nls settings of the session.</p>
	<p>The V format element: inside a format mask you can use the V format element. This is a very unusual case for this we explain now. The V element allows you to scale a value ans its operation, from Oracle: "V->999V99->Returns a value multiplied by 10n (and if necessary, round it up), where n is the number of 9's after the V."</p>
    </li>
    <li>CAST
	<p>Function used to convert numbers to strings and vice versa.</p>
	<p>Syntax: CAST (expression AS datatype)</p>
	<p>Has the disadvantage of not supporting the use of number format models, but has the advantatge that is ISO SQL</p>
    </li>
    <li>Implicit Conversions
	<p>It's the kind of conversion that make pl/sql automatically.</p>
	<p>Try to avoid!!</p>

<li>Numeric Operators
	<p>Check the <a href="">sheet</a></p>
</li>
<li>Numeric Functions
	<p>Check the <a href="">sheet</a> this is only a little remember.</p>
     <ul><li>Rounding and Truncation
	<p>Ceil:Return the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to specified value</br>
	Floor:Returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the specified value.</br>
	Round: Performs rounding on a number.You could round with positive number of decimal(number of digits to the right of the decimal point) places and also with negative number of decimals(number of digits to the left of the decimal point)</br>
	Trunc:Truncates a number to the specified number of decimal places.
	</p>
    </li>
    <li>Trigonometric
	<p>The angles are expressed in radians, not in degrees. To convert use: radians=pi*degrees/180 -- From degrees to radians</br>degrees=radians*180/pi -- From darians to degrees</p>
	<p>pl/sql does not implement a function for &pi;, however you can obtain it with: ACOS(-1).</p>
