<h2>Managing Space</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Explain How Oracle Database Server Automatically Manages Spaces<br>
		We've see in the previous chapter how storage (physical and  logical) works. 
		Now we focusing on the logical part that is cmpound of Tablespaces, segments 
		and oracle blocks.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Extent Management<br>
			space is allocated to a segment in the form of an extent, 
			wich is a set of consecutive oracle blocks. Every datafile has a bitmap that 
			describe the state of the block in the file: whether it's free or are a part of an 
			extent that has been assigned to a segment. When a segment fills up and 
			needs to extend , Oracle seach the bitmaps of the files of the tablespace for 
			free space, select one file and create new extent of an appropriate size by 
			modifyng the  bitmap. The extent can then be assigned to the segment. It's 
			possible for the object to exist without a segment. When a segment it's created 
			it will have at least one extent. The key to understand how it's possible for an 
			object exist without a segment it the parameter DEFERRED_SEGMENT_CREATION 
			wich defaults to true. This parameter instruct oracle to not create a segment 
			until the object actually contains some data, then at table creation time, only 
			the data dictionary structure describing the table is created. Attention because 
			problems of limits of space only appear when the first insert is done, not at the 
			table creation (whit the DEFERRED_SEGMENT_CREATION at true value).  It's 
			possible to override this behavior with SEGMENT CREATION clause of the create 
			table: <code>create table tab1(col1 varchar2(10)) segment creation [deferred|
			immediate];</code><br>
			Note: Segment creation is always immediate for objects created by internal 
			users such SYS or SYSTEM, no matter what the setting of the parameter.
			</li>
			<li>Automatic Segment Space Management (ASSM)<br>
				A table segment consists of multiple blocks, in one or more extents. 
				When an attempt is made to insert a row Oracle must decide into wich block 
				should the row be placed. This is determined by a bitmap that reflects how 
				full each block in the segment is. This mapping works in 25% ranges: 0-25%, 
				25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100% free space.  In addition the bitmap  shows whether 
				the block is not actually formatted at all, that is, it is assigned to the segment 
				but has  not yet been used or is classed as full and is therefore not available 
				for inserts no matter how small the new row is. As rows are inserted and deleted 
				into,from blocks the status of the block is adjusted in the bitmap.<br>
				One of the problems of blocks is the row changes size. The row can change of 
				size because we update a varchar2 (variable length) or update a value that 
				previously has a null. By default Oracle reserve 10 percent of a block for 
				row expansion. This is the PCTFREE (percent free) setting for the segment, set 
				at segment creation time (can be modified later). A block whose usage has 
				exceeded the PCTFREE setting for the segment is classed by the ASSM bitmap 
				as FULL and therefore the block is not available for insert even though it may 
				in fact still have some free space.<br>
				When a row expands such that there is not sufficient space in the block, it 
				must be moved to a block with sufficient space. This is know as row migration.<br>
				Note: Row migration is caused by update statements. Insert and delete can never 
				result in row migration. When a row is migrated, the update it's like it was transformed 
				in insert and after delete, then a more expensive operation. The rowid of the row (
				the physical locator of the row) is not changed.The rowid still point to the original 
				block wich now stores no more than a "forwarding address" pointing to the new 
				block wich the row has been moved. The fact that the rowid remains is good because 
				the index is not modified, but is bad because when the row is retrieved through an 
				index search, an extra I/O operation will be needed.<br>
				Closely related to row migration is the issue of row chaining. A chained row is a row 
				that is larger than the block, like a row of 20k with 8k blocks, then the row must 
				be distributed across three blocks. In this case we need 3 blocks. At insert time 
				the three blocks will be located by searching the ASSM bitmap for blocks available 
				for insertion and when retrieving the row later all three blocks may be read (depend 
				on wich columns are projected by the query). The rowid of a chained row points to 
				the first block of the row, as is also the case with a migrated row.
			</li>
			<li>Save space by using compresion<br>
				The primary purpose of compression is to reduce disk space requirements, but 
				there is sometimes a fringe benefit: improved performance for subsequent 
				queries. Sometimes the opposed, performance degradation. An advisor 
				capability will estimate the space savings that compression can achieve for a 
				table.<br>
				Compression comes in three forms:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Basic table compresion compresses data within a block when rows are 
						inserted through a direct load operation. Subsequent DM operation will 
						cause the rows to be uncompressed (and possibly migrated as a result 
						of this)<br>
						Basic compression (default) is in fact de-deplication. If a repeating pattern of 
						characters occurs withing a block, the patterns is storesd once only in a symbol 
						table, with a reference to the symbol table stored in each row where the pattern 
						occurs.
					</li>
					<li>
						Advanced row compression will compress row no matter how they are 
						inserted, and mantain the compression though DML. The compression 
						is still on a block-by-block basis.<br>
						This compression use the same de-duplication technology of the basic 
						table compresion
					</li>
					<li>
						Hybrid Columnar Compression (HCC) restructures data into compression 
						units of several megabytes, and is available only on certain storage 
						platforms.<br>
						This is a true compression, because use compression algorithms. HCC is 
						not applied per block, but across groups of blocks (wich further enhances the 
						achievable compression ratios).
					</li>
				</ul>
				The type of compression is determined at table creation time, but can be added or 
				removed after creation, but any such change will not affect existing rows. To bring 
				the change into effect, the table must be reorganized (alter table ... move...).<br>
				Basic compression: <code>create table ... compress [basic]</code><br>
				Advanced compression: <code>create table ... row store compress advanced</code><br>
			</li>
		</ul>		
	</li>
	<li>Proactively Monitor and Manage Tablespace Space Usage<br>
		The database will automatically monitor tablespace usage, through the server alert system.
		We can use the DBA_THRESHOLDS view :
		<code>select object_name, warning_value,
			critical_operator, critical_value from dba_thresholds where metrics_name='Tablespace 
			Space Usage';
		</code><br>
		Attention with temporary tablespace and undo tablespace. It's not useful to check the usage 
		because normally is full and this is normal. The important of this tablespace is when the 
		segments within them are full, that is another (and more complex metric), not configured 
		by default.<br>
		The history of the space usage of the tablespace is stored in the AWR snapshots created by 
		the MMON process. This information can be seen in the DBA_HIST_TBSPC_SPACE_USAGE
	</li>
	<li>Use the Segment Advisor<br>
		The segment advisor is a tool that attemtps to generate recommendation regarding 
		reorganizing segments to reclaim space. Deletion frees up space within the segment, 
		but the segment itself remains the same size.<br>
		But it's not enough to know if the segment now is empty: if you have an stage table 
		where you load data, process, move to the definitively tables and finally delete (DWH 
		usually), if you look the segment of this table when it was deleted, then it's like all 
		the space could be recover, but the next day you load data another time, and if you 
		remove the space of the segment, this need to be assigned another time. With this example 
		whe demostrate that the history of the segments is important to know if a space is candidate 
		to be recovered. The segment Advisor can do this. It consider data in the AWR as well 
		as the current state of the object.<br>
		The Segment Advisor runs, by default, every night as an autotask scheduled job. The 
		autotask does not attempt to analyze every segment, it select segments on these criteria:
		<ul>
			<li>Segments in tablespaces that have crossed a space usage threshold</li>
			<li>Segments that have had the mos activity</li>
			<li>Segments that have the highest growth rate</li>
		</ul>
		To see the results of the autotask, use the DBMS_SPACE.ASA_RECOMMENDATIONS 
		function that return a table with the results of the last run.
	</li>
	<li>Reclaim wasted space from tables and indexes by using the segment shrink functionality<br>
		Whe a row is deleted, the space becomes availabe for reuse when another row is inserted. 
		However, the nature of the activity against a table can result in a significant amount 
		of wasted space within the table. This could be reclaimed with a MOVE operation: 
		following a move, all the blocks will be consecutively full of freshly reinserted rows, but 
		during the move, the table is locked, and following it all the indexes must be rebuilt. 
		To avoid it, the SHRINK command can be run without any impact on end users. A 
		limitation is that the table's tablespace must have been created to use automatic segment 
		space management.<br>
		The underlaying implementation of a table shrink is to relocate rows from the end of the table 
		into blocks toward the beginning of the table, by means of matched INSERT and DELETE 
		operations, and then, when all possible moves have been done, to bring the high water mark 
		of the table down to the last currently used block and release all the space above this 
		point. There are two distinct phases: the compact phase moves the rows in a series of 
		small transactions, through normal DML that generates both undo and redo and uses row 
		lock. The second phase is a DDL command. As with any DDL command this is a transaction 
		against the data dictionary: it will execute almost instantaneously, but will require a very 
		short table lock. This last step is often referred to as "relocating the high water mark (HWM)" of 
		the segment.<br>
		Note: A table shrink operation generates undo and redo. Indexes are maintained, because 
		the shrink is implemented as a set of DML transactions. There is no table lock during the 
		compaction, but individual rows will be locked while they are being moved.<br>
		Syntax: 
			<code>alter table table_name shrink space [COMPACT] [CASCADE];</code>.
		 Using COMPACT  carries out the first phase, but not the second: the rows are relocated, but 
		 the space is not actually released from the segment. The reason for using this is that 
		 while the compaction can occur during normal  running hours (though it may take many 
		 hours to complete on a large table), it is possible that the DDL at the end will hang due 
		 to concurrency with other transactions, and it will also invalidate parsed SQL in the library 
		 cache. So it may be necessary to shrink  the table with the COMPACT keyword first, and 
		 then again without COMPACT during a maintenance period: it will be fast, because the 
		 compaction will have already been done. The CASCADE keyword instructs Oracle also 
		 to shrink dependent objects, such  as indexes.<br>
		 Before a table can be shrunk, you must enable row movement for the table: 
		 <code>alter table tablename enable row movement;</code><br>
		 Note: The shrink space compact command reorganizes the contents of the segment, but 
		 does not return space to the tablespace.<br>
		 Enabling row movement is necessary because the nature of the operation means that 
		 row IDs will be changing. The same row (no change to the primary key) will be in a 
		 different physical location and will therefore have a different row id. This is something that 
		 Oracle will not permit unless row movement has been enabled.<br>
		 Note: A table must be in a tablespace with automatic segment space management and 
		 row movement must have been enabled, or it cannot be shrunk. If these conditions have 
		 not been met, a MOVE may be the only way to reorganize the table.<br>
		 Compression is incompatible with SHRINK SPACE: you will need to uncompress before 
		 shrinking . To do this, use ALTER TABLE...NOCOMPRESS and ALTER TABLE...MOVE.
	</li>
	<li>Manage Resumable Space Allocation<br>
		A example: try to load a table, first fails because tablespace goes out of space. Readjust 
		the tablespace, then fails because the undo tablespace runs out of space. Adjust it, then 
		when oracle is generating the index fail because temporary tablespace runs out of space, 
		and so on. The resumable space allocation feature can be the solution.<br>
		If you enable resumable space allocation, when an operation hits a space problem (any 
		space problem at all), rather than failing with an error the operation will be suspended. 
		To te user , this will show as the session hanging. When the error condition is resolved, it 
		will continue. All suspend sessions (currently suspended and previously suspended but 
		now running again) are listed in dba_resumable.<br>
		To enable resumable space allocation at the session level:
		<code>alter session enable resumable [timeout seconds]</code><br>
		The TIMEOUT option lets you specify for how log the statement should hang, if timeout 
		the error is returned and the statement fails. If not specifiy timeout then the session 
		hang indefenitily.<br>
		It's also possible to enable resumable space for all sessions by setting an instance 
		parameter. This is a dynamic parameter. 
		<code>alter system set resumable_timeout=60;</code><br>
		Note: expdp and impdp data pump utilities have the command-line switch 
		RESUMABLE=Y (default N), wich will allow data pump jobs to suspend if they hit space 
		problems.<br>
		An interesting trigger to control the problems with space:<br>
		<code>
		create trigger detect_suspend after suspend on database<br>
		begin<br>
		utl_mail.send(sender=>'dba@mycompany.com',<br>
		recipients=>'dba@mycompany.com'<br>
		subject=>'DB session suspended'.<br>
		message=>'resumable space allocation event occurred'<br>
		);<br>
		end;
		</code><br>
